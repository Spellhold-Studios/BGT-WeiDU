//Find Phlydia's lost book.
//PHLYDI.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @16002 - 0*/
@310000 = ~Find Phlydia's lost book.

Dear, absent-minded Phlydia has lost another of her books, "The History of Halruaa," this time. Last time she was at Candlekeep, she lost an entire four-volume set in the hay we keep for the cows.~
/*SOLVED   - @16534 - 2*/
@310001 = ~Find Phlydia's lost book.

Poor, absent-minded Phlydia gave me a gem for returning her lost book. Candlekeep, it seems, continues to defy all laws of economics: the more books it holds, the more valuable they become to those who read them. The greater the supply, the greater the demand... Bah, all this thinking is making my head hurt. Time to pawn this gem and get something useful for it.~
/*SOLVED   - @16535 - 3*/
@310002 = ~Find Phlydia's lost book.

In classic form, Phlydia almost seemed to have forgotten that she had sent me in search of her book in the first place. Oh well, I guess there's more to a favor than the reward at its end.~


//Get Firebead Elvenhair's Identify scroll.
//FIREB1.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @16024 - 0*/
@310003 = ~Get Firebead Elvenhair's Identify scroll.

Firebead Elvenhair, an old mage who makes the occasional visit here from Beregost, has left a Identify scroll with Tethtoril, in the inner grounds.  I swear, without me to run its endless errands, this keep would crumble into the very dust from which it sprang.~
/*SOLVED   - @16526 - 2*/
@310004 = ~Get Firebead Elvenhair's Identify scroll.

Old Firebead was grateful for for my help. He cast a spell on me and said it would protect me from any evil I might meet tonight... I don't know what's out there beyond these walls but I guess I'll find out soon enough.~


//Find a Potion of Antidote for Dreppin.
//DREPPI.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @16007 - 0*/
@310005 = ~Find a Potion of Antidote for Dreppin.

Nessa the Cow is feeling a bit under the weather today. Dreppin's asked me to get a potion of antidote from Hull, who's been posted to the gate this morning. It appears that Hull has been using them to avoid his morning hangovers...~
/*SOLVED   - @16525 - 2,3*/
@310006 = ~Find a Potion of Antidote for Dreppin.

Well, I found that potion for Dreppin's cow. I just hope it's what he thinks it is and not a potion of firebreath or something...~


//Clear a rat-infested storehouse.
//REEVOR.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15706 - 0*/
@310007 = ~Clear a rat-infested storehouse.

Reevor has once again pressed me into service in his storehouse. All reports suggest that our feline forces have turned traitor and that the rats are on the offensive. It appears that I am our last hope in the face of such an awesome display of power. Farewell, dear Journal... Farewell.~
/*SOLVED   - @16536 - 2*/
@310008 = ~Clear a rat-infested storehouse.

Mental Note: Don't join the armed forces. They never inform you of the full danger when you enter and they always pay you squat when you leave... Reevor gave me all of five gold pieces for putting my life on the line in there... Isn't there a Candlekeep People's Revolutionary Front I can join, somewhere???~


//Retrieve Hull's sword from the barracks.
//HULL.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15965 - 0*/
@310009 = ~Retrieve Hull's sword from the barracks.

Hull, one of the ever-present Watchers here in Candlekeep, forgot his sword in the barracks this morning. He has asked me to fetch the weapon from its resting place in the chest against the right wall.~
/*SOLVED   - @16529 - 1*/
@310010 = ~Retrieve Hull's sword from the barracks.

The Gatewarden sure must have been in a surly mood, today, because Hull paid a full 20 gp for that sword of his!~
/*SOLVED   - @16530 - 3*/
@310011 = ~Retrieve Hull's sword from the barracks.

Hull gave me 10 gp for bringing him his own dumb sword. I should have charged him extra for the tongue-lashing he gave me, though.~


//Fetch a quarrel of crossbow bolts for Fuller.
//FULLER.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @16019 - 3*/
@310012 = ~Fetch a quarrel of crossbow bolts for Fuller.

Fuller's recovering from last night's mead-fest in the barracks. After a little pestering, he agreed to give me a little bit of change if I fetch a quarrel of crossbow bolts from the innkeeper, Winthrop.~
/*SOLVED   - @16527 - 5*/
@310013 = ~Fetch a quarrel of crossbow bolts for Fuller.

Fuller was in a generous mood, today. After I fetched the bolts from Winthrop, he gave me his dad's old dagger. It killed a hobgoblin in a single blow, once... if Fuller isn't just pulling my leg again, that is.~
/*SOLVED   - @16528 - 6*/
@310014 = ~Fetch a quarrel of crossbow bolts for Fuller.

Fuller gave me a lousy 10 gold for running his errands. I bet I'd get at least 15 for being an errand runner in Baldur's Gate!~


//Find Joia’s Flamedance Ring.
//JOIA.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @11904 - 4*/
@310015 = ~Find Joia’s Flamedance Ring.

I am to return a ring to Joia in the Friendly Arm Inn. It is a flamedance ring, and was stolen by some hobgoblins just north of the inn.~
/*SOLVED   - @17052 - 7*/
@310016 = ~Find Joia’s Flamedance Ring.

I returned a flamedance ring to Joia in the Friendly Arm Inn. She was very appreciative, even if she had no gold to give me.~


//Find Unshey's Girdle of Piercing.
//UNSHEY.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15723 - 1*/
@310017 = ~Find Unshey's Girdle of Piercing.

According to a dwarven cleric by the name of Unshey, a rogue ogre with a belt fetish is making a name for himself just south of the Friendly Arm Inn. As Unshey claims to be an author, maybe she'd give me a copy of her book if I can get her girdle of piercing back...~
/*SOLVED   - @16537 - 4*/
@310018 = ~Find Unshey's Girdle of Piercing.

Unshey isn't the most charismatic person I've ever met. She gave me 70 gold pieces for returning her girdle but only after informing me that 60 of those were to go towards my bathing fund.~
/*SOLVED   - @16538 - 5*/
@310019 = ~Find Unshey's Girdle of Piercing.

One dead ogre equals 95 gold pieces. Unshey claims to be a writer but it sure is hard to argue with her math.~
/*SOLVED   - @16539 - 6*/
@310020 = ~Find Unshey's Girdle of Piercing.

It appears that one of the girdles in that ogre's fetish collection was, how can I phrase it... one of gender transformation? Unshey was not unsympathetic to this, ahem, rather unfortunate turn of events, however. In an effort to make amends she has offered us a copy of her book, entitled "High Cleric Unshey's Practical Guide to Bodily Health".~


//Spiders, boots, and wine.
//LANDRI.DLG, AR6803.BAF (erases entries)
/*UNSOLVED - @15700 - 0*/
@310021 = ~Spiders, boots, and wine.

Landrin, a gnome at the Friendly Arm Inn, appears to think I am her lowly errand runner. Apparently too lazy to walk down the stairs and purchase one from the barkeep, she insists that I fetch her precious wine bottle from the cellar of her house in Beregost... To be honest, at 75 gp, the thought is almost tempting. The house, should I ever seek it out, lies just west of the Jovial Juggler Inn in Beregost. She said something about stepping on spiders and her husband's old boots, but I didn't listen too intently.~
/*UNSOLVED - @15699 - 1*/
@310022 = ~Spiders, boots, and wine.

Landrin, a gnome at the Friendly Arm Inn, has apparently fled her home due to a recent spider infestation in her cellar. The house, she informs me, lies just west of the Jovial Juggler Inn in Beregost. Much as I would rather not have them in my pack, she insists on seeing the bodies of the spiders before I am to receive any payment. She hinted at an extra bit of reward if I bring her husband's old boots and her bottle of wine as well.~
/*UNSOLVED - @15701 - 2*/
@310023 = ~Spiders, boots, and wine.

Landrin, a gnome at the Friendly Arm Inn, has apparently fled her home due to a recent spider infestation in her cellar. The house, she informs me, lies just west of the Jovial Juggler Inn in Beregost. Her husband's boots, apparently of some small import to her, can be found therein and I am to present them to her before I claim my reward. She might give something extra for her bottle of wine and one of the spider bodies as well.~
/*SOLVED   - @16531 - 3*/
@310024 = ~Spiders, boots, and wine.

75 gold for Landrin's wine, must have been a good vintage...or vicious home-brew.~
/*SOLVED   - @16532 - 4*/
@310025 = ~Spiders, boots, and wine.

Landrin has paid a pretty penny for the body of the biggest spider in her house. 100 gold pieces and, to be honest, I earned every piece.~
/*SOLVED   - @16533 - 5*/
@310026 = ~Spiders, boots, and wine.

120 pieces of hard gold currency for an old pair of boots. A good deal by any measure, despite the creatures guarding them.~


//A family of zombies.
//KELDDA.DLG - removes entries
/*SOLVED   - @10250 - 1*/
@310027 = ~A family of zombies.

I have been well rewarded for dispatching the foul Bassilus. No doubt this 5000 gold shall come in quite handy.~
/*UNSOLVED - @10718 - 8*/
@310028 = ~A family of zombies.

While we were in the temple east of Beregost Kelddath Ormlyr told us that there is a price on the head of a man named Bassilus.  We will be entitled to a large reward if we can eliminate Bassilus and bring back his holy symbol as proof of the deed.~
//BASSIL.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @6550 - 3,4*/
@310324 = ~A family of zombies.

The evil priest Bassilus seems to be insane.  He believes that the undead that he controls are the living members of his family.  He also believes that I am his parent.~
/*UNSOLVED - @6551 - 14*/
@310325 = ~A family of zombies.

When I charmed Bassilus I learned that he is from Zhentil Keep.  It would seem that his family was slaughtered when the city was destroyed.  This event caused him to lose his mind.~
//FOOTY.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @19284 - 1,2*/
@310368 = ~A family of zombies.

Poor, young Footy is as tragically mad as everyone else in this dreadful place. He has been watching the foul Bassillus, trying to spot his own family amongst the animated corpses, laughing at their antics as he does so... Guilt and innocence are so malleable in this affair. All I know is that I cannot bear to let this depravity continue any longer.~
//TOWNCR.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @7262 - 0*/
@310543 = ~A family of zombies.

We have heard of a bounty of 5000 gold upon the head of a man named Bassilus.  Kelddath Ormlyr will give us the reward.  Kelddath can be found in the temple of Lathander just east of Beregost.~

The townsfolk of Beregost talk of a 'monster' named Bassilus, who has murdered many innocent folk.~
//RBEREG.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @16353 - 22*/
@310571 = ~A family of zombies.

I heard in Beregost that a reward is currently being offered for the head of Bassilus, a priest that apparently controls undead.~


//Find Gurke's famous cloak.
//GURKE.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15794 - 1*/
@310029 = ~Find Gurke's famous cloak.

Gurke, a crusty old dwarf in Beregost, has had his supposedly famous cloak stolen from him by a batch of tasloi in the Cloakwood. After our brief encounter, I have come to the conclusion that I'd do almost anything to rid him of that sour mood!~
/*SOLVED   - @16669 - 3*/
@310030 = ~Find Gurke's famous cloak.

The return of Gurke's cloak seems to have lightened his disposition, somewhat, at least. What is more, his purse is 280 gp lighter for it, too. Not bad for a few days of work, if I may say so myself.~
/*SOLVED   - @16670 - 4*/
@310031 = ~Find Gurke's famous cloak.

I have traveled to the Cloakwood, returned with Gurke's cloak, and all for naught! It does appear that his misadventures have turned him into a minor folk hero here in Beregost. People toss coins at his feet to hear his embellished prattle but I swear I shall have none of it. Fie on him and the cloak he left with me, too!~


//A deed for an old friend.
//FIREBE.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15730 - 1*/
@310032 = ~A deed for an old friend.

I have met an old friend in Beregost! Firebead Elvenhair, an elderly mage who visited the library at Candlekeep on occasion, has asked me to check out the stores in the area and purchase a copy of "The History of the Fateful Coin" for him, should I ever set eyes on it. Confining as its walls could be, there are days when I miss Candlekeep with every bone and every ounce of flesh in my body. This, I guess, is just going to be one of those days...~
/*SOLVED   - new - 2,3*/
@310033 = ~A deed for an old friend.

Firebead Elvenhair has given me another book in exchange for "The History of the Fateful Coin". He says it is a touch darker than what I gave him.  I guess I will find out if I really enjoy it when I read it.  I hope I see him again one day.  He has always been a great friend...~


//Zhurlong's boots.
//ZHURLO.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15724 - 1,2*/
@310034 = ~Zhurlong's boots.

A pesky thief named Zhurlong has been pickpocketing me every time I try to get a word in edgewise but I'd rather not cause a scene. He did mention losing some boots to hobgoblins in the badlands south of the city, though. I get the sense, somehow, that returning those boots to him may be the only way to make peace and have my goods returned.  He can be found in the Burning Wizard tavern at Beregost.~
/*SOLVED   - @14828 - 4*/
@310035 = ~Zhurlong's boots.

Well, Zhurlong is making progress in our ongoing joint therapy sessions. He has confessed his kleptomanic tendencies and has even gone so far as to return the gold that he has stolen from me thus far. Most surprising, however, has been his offer of 100 gp above and beyond what was actually due. Sadly, he referred to it as a down payment on my pocket... Nevertheless, with time, I still hold out hope that he might be cured.~


//A stampede of half-ogres.
//BJORNI.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15795 - 1*/
@310036 = ~A stampede of half-ogres.

Bjornin, a paladin currently healing from his wounds in Beregost's Jovial Juggler Inn, has asked me to uproot a band of half-ogres. According to his report, they have been fortifying themselves in the mountains south-southwest of town.~
/*SOLVED   - @16668 - 3*/
@310037 = ~A stampede of half-ogres.

The half-ogres may have battered his body but Bjornin's heart remains the purest gold. In his gratitude, he has granted us a fine and well-weighted shield. Something tells me that there might even be some magic about it.~


//An ankheg fortune.
//TAEROM.DLG

Today I sold that anhkeg shell I found for 500 gold!  It's a fortune!~
/*JOURNAL - @5834 - 3*/
@310039 = ~An ankheg fortune.

Taerom "Thunderhammer" has offered to buy the Anhkeg shell I found for 500 gold!  I have but a tenday to make up my mind.  Beyond that the shell will spoil.~
/*JOURNAL - @5837 - 7,8*/
@310040 = ~An ankheg fortune.

Taerom is making a suit of plate out of my anhkeg shell.  It will be ready within a tenday.~
/*JOURNAL - @5836 - 10,11*/
@310041 = ~An ankheg fortune.

Taerom "Thunderhammer" has offered to make plate of my anhkeg shell.  It will cost 4000 gold to make, and he mentioned that he heard there was a reward for 5000 gold on the head of a criminal named Bassilus.~
/*JOURNAL - new - 9*/
@310042 = ~An ankheg fortune.

Today, Taerom "Thunderhammer" has completed an ankheg plate.  It is a marvellous piece of handiwork and I cannot wait to put it to good use.~

We have been hired by a woman named Silke to protect her from some thugs hired out by a man named Feldepost.~
/*SOLVED   - new - 8*/
@310044 = ~To mug a bard, or to mug a mug.

We were been hired by a woman named Silke to protect her from some thugs hired out by a man named Feldepost.  It turns out that Silke is really an evil mage who intended to kill a group of messengers for their wares.  She won't be troubling anyone anymore.~
/*SOLVED   - new - 10*/
@310045 = ~To mug a bard, or to mug a mug.

I have helped Silke dispatch of a group of ruffians who tried to trick me into believing that they were simpleton merchants.  I was not going to fall for that ploy and removed them quickly.~


//Find news from Mirianne's husband.
//MIRIAN.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @15725 - 0*/
@310046 = ~Find news from Mirianne's husband.

I was moved by the pleas of Mirianne of Beregost, today. Her husband, Roe, had to make a trip south to Amn and she is understandably worried for his safety. I have sworn to keep my eyes open for any news of relevance I might encounter in my journeys down that road.~
/*SOLVED   - @16671 - 1*/
@310048 = ~Find news from Mirianne's husband.

I have completed the task that a nameless halfling messenger, now dead and mourned, started deep in the heart of Amn. Mirianne has received her husband's letter by my hand and I am glad to hear that it bears good tidings of his safety. I am humbled by her offer of a simple ring to keep me safe. Be it magic or superstition, I know not, but I will wear it, at least, to remember her by.~


//Retrieve Perdue's sword.

@310049 = ~Retrieve Perdue's sword.

Feeling somewhat sheepish after treating him so poorly, I have agreed to retrieve the sword of poor Perdue the halfling from a band of gnolls apparently lurking in the plains west of Beregost, close to the High Hedge.~
/*UNSOLVED - @15705 - 8*/
@310050 = ~Retrieve Perdue's sword.

Against my better judgement, I have agreed to find and return the sword stolen from Perdue the halfling. If his directions are correct, I should find it amidst a band of gnolls apparently lurking in the hills west of the Friendly Arm Inn, very close to the High Hedge wizard home.~
/*SOLVED   - @16672 - 14*/
@310051 = ~Retrieve Perdue's sword.

I have received 50 gp and Perdue's grudging thanks for the return of his short sword but little else. In retrospect, I shouldn't be surprised as he has been a pest and a nuisance from the start. Ah well, I knew his price was low when I went into it.~

Officer Jessa Vai of the Flaming Fist is marooned in Beregost with her contingent. In her desperation to return to Baldur's Gate, she's offered me 50 gp for every bandit scalp I can bring her. She'll be waiting for me at the Jovial Juggler Inn.~
/*SOLVED   - new - 6*/
@311054 = ~In want of bandit scalps.

We had a good business on selling bandit scalps to officer Jessa Vai of the Flaming Fist but she has received an order from Baldur's Gate headquarters to return there to make a report an a matter of eliminating bandits threat. Could she open a tanner or a taxidermist business after all?~

Rumor from Volo: I hear that Commander Brage, of the Amnish guard, has been missing for some weeks now, following a strange alteration in his behavior.  Where once he was a well thought-of  family man, he turned to senseless mayhem, effecting a rampage the likes of which I have never heard.  His fellow soldiers noted nothing out of sorts that could trigger such a transformation, but one notable item seems relevant.  If not for the iron shortage it would have gone unnoticed but, prior to his mad rage, the commander procured a new sword.  The importance of this information, I have no way of verifying.~

It seems the Iron Throne is negotiating a treaty with the city's Grand Dukes. Is this simple treaty the key to ending all the unrest of the past season or is it just another link in the long chain of motivations? Will money satisfy the Throne's greed or is there something more behind it all? I have so many questions and, while I feel so close to finding answers, I somehow doubt that they will be quite as fulfilling as I hope...~

When we threatened Thaldorn, he told us that Reiltar and Brunos, his business partners, were at Candlekeep.~
/*UNSOLVED - @6569 - 5*/
@310133 = ~Investigate the Iron Throne.

When we charmed Thaldorn we learned a lot of information about the Iron Throne.  They want to become the pre-eminent trading cartel along the Sword Coast.  To do this, they have been using a misinformation campaign to raise tensions between the nations of Baldur's Gate and Amn.  They have disrupted the flow of iron into Baldur's Gate by sabotaging the Nashkel mines, and using the Chill and Black Talons to cut off all trade along the Sword Coast.  The only iron source in the Sword Coast will be the Iron Throne base in Cloakwood.  With Baldur's Gate anticipating a war with Amn, they will be forced to go to the Iron Throne for the most precious of war time materials.  When this occurs, the Iron Throne will be able to make any demands that they wish.~

Koveras has suggested that I kill the leaders of the Iron Throne, while they're here at Candlekeep.  The thought of bringing violence to such a place makes me queasy, but perhaps it's something that needs to be done.  I wish Gorion was here to guide me.~

//DIARMID.DLG

@310139 = ~Investigate the Iron Throne.

I met Diarmid outside of the Candlekeep crypts and he mistook my group for that of a cohort of his named Prat. He spilled the beans and revealed that it was Sarevok's plan to have me accused of the murders of the Iron Throne leaders, whether I could be goaded into the act or not. Dopplegangers were to impersonate me and ensure I would be blamed. With my party wanted by the law and Brunos and the others dead, Sarevok thinks he stands unopposed. He has returned to Baldur's Gate and plans to take control of the city somehow, likely using his leverage as the new head of the Iron Throne, so I should probably check their base out again. His end goal seems to be war with Amn, but his reasons are still not clear to me.~

We have learned that the drunk Husam has been putting up an act all this time.  He is actually a member of the Shadow Thieves.  The Shadow Thieves are concerned at how the nations of Amn and Baldur's Gate have been maneuvered close to a war.~

An old gent named Entillis Fulsom seems well-acquainted with my ongoing investigations into the Iron Throne. He has recommended to me the assistance of Scar and Duke Eltan, two men associated with the honorable Flaming Fist Mercenaries, here in Baldur's Gate... It seems that he is acting with Elminster.

The Chanter tells me that the men from the Iron Throne are on the third floor of the Central Keep, meeting with two others from the Knights of the Shield. About what, I cannot fathom but I suspect my path lies in their direction nonetheless. The Chanter also mentioned another stranger, a man named Koveras, studying the prophecies of Alaundo where they are kept on the second floor. Who's to say whether or not he is connected to this mystery? All the same, it is no doubt wise to be aware of his presence here.~

@310362 = ~Investigate the Iron Throne.

When we charmed Entar Silvershield he told us quite a bit.  He said that the Iron Throne had recently set up in Baldur's Gate and was offering to sell iron to the city.  The Grand Dukes are worried about an invasion from Amn, and are thus taking the Iron Throne's offer seriously, despite some reservations about their intentions.~
//FELDAN.DLG

I ran into old Feldane, one of the monks who has lived at Candlekeep since before I can remember. He said that there are suspicious visitors staying at the keep, and that they are making use of the meeting rooms. He suspects that several of them are from the Iron Throne, while the remainder are from the Knights of the Shield. Apparently they are negotiating for control of various regions in the Sword Coast. In his opinion neither of these groups is entirely respectable, though they have done nothing wrong while here.~

Karan, my old tutor, has told me something most interesting: Koveras seems quite well-acquainted with the prophecies of Alaundo the Seer. So well, in fact, that he can recite them with his eyes closed. It may be worth my while to take some of those well-worn tomes off their shelves near where Karan and I spoke. Koveras himself must still be in the building as I have not seen anyone of his description leave. Whoever he may be, I do not intend to let him avoid me like this forever.~

//STEPHA.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @10102 - 4,6*/
@310532 = ~Investigate the Iron Throne.

After defeating the mage Davaeorn I questioned his sniveling apprentice Stephan Re'Cap. He confirmed much of what I already knew: The Iron Throne is the organization behind the iron crisis, though I think the name is just a coincidence. Mulahey was to destroy the effectiveness of the Nashkel mine, while bandits stopped incoming caravans. The perceived threat of the shortage likely inflamed fears and exaggerated the problem.

The Iron Throne was going to try and look like the saviors of the day, riding in with their stores of iron to equip the troops or something like that. With the bandit raids and the rumors about Amn, the Iron Throne figured that the Dukes of Baldur's Gate would think they needed arms and ore quickly in case of Amnish attack. They figured they could get exorbitant prices, or better yet, sanctions against competitors and an easing of trade laws for themselves only. A quick way to install themselves as an underground power on the coast while maintaining a veneer of respectability as a merchant consortium, unless they got caught, of course.

The three regional leaders of the Iron Throne placed Davaeorn in charge of the mine. Stephan also said that Davaeorn was getting orders from someone else too, and that he complained about it a lot, but he never said a name. The main building for the Iron Throne is apparently in Baldur's Gate, somewhere in the south west of the city.~
//TRIADO.DLG

@310546 = ~Investigate the Iron Throne.

The Iron Throne tower is apparently no place for the faint of heart. A very distraught merchant by the name of Triadore nearly bowled me over on his reckless charge for the exit. Luckily I was uninjured and the impact slowed him enough that I could lure him into a frantic (and expensive) conversation. According to his hurried testimony, the tower's fifth floor is home to a small fanatical sect of some sort, acolytes of someone named Sarevok. It is becoming more and more apparent that there is more behind the Iron Throne than simple greed. Some secret agenda is afoot and, for the life of me, I must discover it.~

Pheirkas, a dwarven fighter in Baldur's Gate, has asked me to undertake what I can only call a covert mission. Staying at Feldepost's Inn in Beregost is the apparently obese Algernon.

Quenash has given me the Cloak of Balduran, but had very little information about the location of the Helm. She said Vail did mention it once, and her exact words were that "he could not have found a better location to hide both the cloak and the helm, and that the building was practically named for the purpose, but that he would let me (Quenash) keep the cloak because he did not want both items in such a public place."~

The thieves' maze was built long ago, and now serves as a decoy escape route to fool trespassers. It is maintained by undead and kept clean by jellies, likely enslaved by some long forgotten thief adept at magic. It leads to the Undercity, an old settlement that once stood where Baldur's Gate is now. Nothing but undead down there now, supposedly.~
//WINSKI.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @11661 - 4,5*/
@310599 = ~Kill Sarevok.

I found Winski Perorate near the entrance to the Undercity. Apparently he was Sarevok's mentor, but he was cast aside because he dared to rescue Sarevok instead of killing the Grand Dukes as he was supposed to. Winski said he knew I would follow, because Sarevok and I are of the same blood; blood that is also divine. War with Amn was not Sarevok's true goal after all. It was the slaughter of the initial battles that he wished. He thought death on the appropriate scale would cause him to ascend, and he would assume the portfolio of the slain Bhaal. Perhaps he would have, but who can really say? If you have the arrogance of a god and can kill like a god, who's to say you are not a god? I must stop this before he flees to try his scheme anew. There is a temple in the Undercity where Sarevok waits to make his last stand against me. He will not be alone.~

Sarevok is apparently almost as damaging to the Iron Throne as I am. He is using their resources to fund his rise to power in Baldur's Gate. He has also installed one of his lackeys as the new commander of the Flaming Fist, replacing Scar, who died suddenly. His goal is likely to become a Grand Duke, though what he hopes to achieve once he has, no one knows. Most of the citizenry believe him to be a saint, and it would take solid proof to convince them otherwise.~

Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated, and with Duke Eltan on his deathbed an election of sorts has been called. People feel they should not be without a full government in these dangerous times. Sarevok is apparently a frontrunner in this matter.~
/*JOURNAL - @10124 - 13*/

Sarevok is petitioning to be the newest Grand Duke, and who could possibly refuse him? He brings the resources of the fallen Iron Throne, and promises to prepare Baldur's Gate for war with Amn.

Sarevok is to be a Grand Duke, stepping in to replace Entar Silvershield, and he has the full support of the people. He has promised to restore order, and since he created the chaos I am sure he will be fairly successful. Some members of the Iron Throne would not be surprised if he was behind Entar's death. Likely the other Dukes are in similar peril. Sarevok seems bent on causing destruction, and the smallest diversion is crushed viciously. Is he pursuing war with Amn?? What good would this do anyone?~

It would be good to return here when I have more time to listen.~
/*JOURNAL - @9683 - 5*/
@310388 = ~Scar's assassination.

I have listened to the tale of Ivanne, sole witness to Scar's death, save his killer. Judging by Ivanne's telling, Scar was lured to his horrific death by yet another doppelganger, no doubt in the hire of the Iron Throne, though Ivanne thought Angelo might have good cause. Scar's passing was mercifully brief, at least, though more for reasons of stealth than of compassion. Aye, I have seen so many of these foul mirrorkin of late but I pray I never become accustomed to their cursed, shifting faces. If I should get to the bottom of this murder, there are only two places I can think of searching -- the tower of the Iron Throne or the barracks of the Flaming Fist, where Duke Eltan is said to lie in sickly pallor. All else, it seems, is meaningless.~

//HERSCH.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @10104 - 2,3*/
@310379 = ~Re-investigate the Iron Throne.

The iron shortage wanes, but merchants are still without wares. It is the Iron Throne's instability which has prolonged the strife in the city, and that is why other merchants blame them. They were major importers, and without their help it will take much longer to reassure people that all is well. Since Sarevok has assumed control they have ceased most business transactions and frozen most of their assets. The fact that he is crippling a large merchant house seems inconsequential to him. He is disinterested, and seems likely to sacrifice it to fund the re-arming of Baldur's Gate, and thus his bid to become a Grand Duke. I cannot imagine sane businessmen following such directives. Something is very odd at the Iron Throne building indeed.~
//KAELLA.DLG

Sarevok has secured himself as leader of the Iron Throne, and is in the process of all but destroying its mercantile credibility by practically sacking it.

Sarevok has assumed control of the Iron Throne in the wake of their leaders' deaths. He seems disinterested in them, though, and is making decisions that will undoubtedly ruin the whole organization.

I have met Tamoko once again, and agreed to a promise she has requested. She has asked that I defeat Sarevok and crush his plans, but spare his life in the end. She would try to reclaim Sarevok the man, once Sarevok the would-be god is destroyed. In exchange for this she has confirmed my suspicions of Slythe and Kristen, the underlings of Sarevok that killed Duke Entar Silvershield, and indicated that they can be found at their base in the Undercellar. She has also directed me towards someone named Cythandria in the Iron throne base (who seems to be more her rival than mine). Tamoko has also given me much to think about. Sarevok and I are of the same blood; a god's blood. Sarevok thinks he was created to assume the mantle of the dead lord of murder Bhaal, ascending to godhood by causing slaughter on a god-like scale. Tamoko doubts such a thing can happen, claiming that a dead god would not create such children to effect his replacement, rather his resurrection. She seems to think that Sarevok's death will serve Bhaal more than a grand sacrifice in his name. Sarevok has made his beliefs known, but what am I to take from this?

Scar, their second in command, was killed recently and Duke Entar Silvershield was assassinated. Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control of the Flaming Fist, though no one seems to trust him. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. Duke Eltan, the real head of the Flaming Fist, is barely clinging to life. No one seems to be able to help him, even though he is attended around the clock by a healer named Rashad.  With Entar dead and Eltan ill, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the frontrunner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Confronting him directly will have to wait until I have concrete proof to present. No one would take my word over his. Perhaps I might have more luck investigating Angelo at the Flaming Fist headquarters.~
//FFHUNT.DLG

@310365 = ~Investigate the Flaming Fist headquarters.

I have surrendered myself to the Flaming Fist, and must go before Angelo Dosan for judgment. I doubt I shall be treated fairly by this Angelo, but I had little choice. If I were to fight the Flaming Fist I would surely be known as a murderer of guards. They are only following the orders of their new commander and are innocent of any wrongdoing, regardless of their attacks on me. If I am ever faced with the same unfortunate choice in the future, I had best entangle the guards somehow and make my escape without harming them. The fates would not look kindly on my killing innocents, regardless of their intent.~

@310366 = ~Investigate the Flaming Fist headquarters.

I have made the choice to fight the Flaming Fist, though it appears they are only following the command of this Angelo Dosan. It does not matter. If I kill one of them in my escape I shall be known as a murderer of guards. If they are only doing their job, then I shall be angering the fates as well. It would be best to entangle them somehow and run.~

@310393 = ~Investigate the Flaming Fist headquarters.

I have learned that Duke Eltan, Commander of the Flaming Fist, lies sick in bed at the Fist Compound, tended to by his cleric Rashad. A man named Angelo seems to be acting in his stead and, from all accounts, seems to be closely connected to Sarevok and the Flaming Fist. I find myself overwhelmed with a sense of unease about this all. Sick or not, perhaps Duke Eltan has some answers for me.~
/*UNSOLVED - @9649 - 3*/
@310394 = ~Investigate the Flaming FIst headquarters.

The Flaming Fist are gearing up for war and arming themselves with weapons forged from Iron Throne ore. A man named Angelo, with apparent ties to Sarevok, seems to be leading them. All of this leads me to the conclusion that it might be high time I paid a visit to the Flaming Fist barracks in the city.~

Angelo is making a power grab within the Flaming Fist and may be responsible both for Duke Eltan's sickness and Scar's death. His reputed connections to the Iron Throne leave me more than suspicious. It's a question of where to turn -- shall I go back to the Iron Throne and continue my investigations there or should I seek out Duke Eltan at the Flaming Fist compound and test my suspicions regarding his disease?~

I charmed a member of the Flaming Fist and learned that their new commander Angelo has condemned me to death, though they think his motives are tainted. Likely the Flaming Fist will attack me in future as well, so I should refrain from killing them if at all possible. The public would only see me as a murderer of guards, and the fates would undoubtedly frown on my killing innocents, regardless of their intent to harm me.~

I have met Gregor, the son of Brunos, one of the murdered Iron Throne leaders. He is positive that Sarevok orchestrated the whole assassination in order to assume control of the Iron Throne. Sarevok has apparently used the Throne's best plots to inflame the region, instead of to secure wealth and power. He now campaigns to become a Duke, on the premise that he will fight the chaos he himself created. What he hopes to accomplish once he is a Duke, no one seems to know. The region is perilously close to war though.~

Sarevok has sworn that he will stand firm against Amn, even pursuing war if that is what they wish. If he becomes a Grand Duke he will have all the influence he needs to launch an attack. People don't seem to realize that the only person confirming Amn's intentions is Sarevok himself.~

She has asked me to obtain a Bloodstone Amulet from a man named Arkion and return it to her. The only trouble is, Arkion sounds like a rather powerful mage and I get the sense that he won't part with that amulet willingly... There is something about this city that scares me, somehow.

Narlen and Rededge successfully got away with the gold from the DeMallonblade house, but I killed one of the city guard in our escape.

I have been hired by Alatos Thuibuld to do a bit of burglary. I am to sneak into Oberon's estate and steal several magical components from the three daughters of Shandalar. These components are the ingredients for creating a Halruaan flying ship, and the Halruaans want their secret preserved and the items stolen. Alatos suggested that I either 'persuade' the daughters to release the items, or spirit them out from under their noses.

It would seem my escapades with Narlen and Rededge gained me more than a few gold coins or some gems. Because I proved myself as a fellow thief worthy of the guild, Narlen stepped in to save my skin when I was threatened. It seems Alatos originally hired me because I was expendable, and he knew Resar would kill whoever did the job. Narlen wouldn't stand for it, and killed Resar before I was in any danger. Alatos quickly agreed to spare me, lest he face a number of mutinous thieves. I have made some valuable friends through all of this.~

His sentences overwrought with emphatic hesitations, G'Axir the Seer has informed me that my future is hemmed in darkness. His predictions are less than surprising... Even so, he has asked me to bring him a Sphene Gem that apparently lies within the harbor.  G'Axir can be found at the Blade and Stars.~
/*SOLVED - new - 4*/
@310293 = ~Find a sphene gem.

G'Axir appreciated me finding a sphene gem, but his dark tidings seem to trouble me more.  Apparently, there may be some kind of ancient 'undercity' which lies beneath Baldur's Gate where I must walk through the darkness to find the light.  Sounds like something straight out of a fantasy book!~

I have met Shaella, one of the most mind-boggling priestesses that I will ever come to meet.  She claims to worship Leira, the Lady of Mists that apparently does not exist.  Somehow I get the feeling that to be able to make conversation with her, I have to speak the opposite of what I think.~
/*JOURNAL - @15791 - 11*/
@310295 = ~Misty revelations.

Shaella, a most interesting priestess of Leira, has sent me on a pilgrimage home to Candlekeep, wherein lies the Great Book of the Unknowing. To read from its pages, nay even to touch this Greatest of Books, blesses one with the ignorance that only it can grant. I will speak with her again once I have found it.~
/*JOURNAL - @15791 - 10,16*/
@310296 = ~Misty revelations.

Blessed with ignorance by touching the Great Book of the Unknowing, which doesn't exist but lies in ether, I rediscovered the false face of Elnaedra, the ignoramus of Shaella, priestess of Leira.  Oh hell, why does this have to rhyme??~

I encountered an old sage who goes by the entirely justified name of Mad Arcand... Even through the froth of his insanity, some interesting clues have surfaced, however. He claims there is a ship along the shoreline containing something of value. He has asked, in his way, that I return this mysterious item to him, making sure not to use it in the interim... For all his apparent madness, however, I cannot help but be suspicious of this strange man.~
/*SOLVED - @16673 - 3*/
@310312 = ~Some trinket.

Oh Mad, Mad Arcand with your crumbling mind, your dizzying ditties are more cryptic than kind. But thanks for this bottle, whate'er it might be. Oh I'm tempted, so tempted to look in and see... but you've warned me against it and to your words I'll stay true, at least so long as I'm wanting to.~

I feel ashamed to take it but Ardrouine has thrust her last 60 gold pieces into my hands. At least her son is safe, though nightmares will surely keep him from that old abandoned lighthouse for years to come. Alas but there flees a child's innocence, shamed and broken by the Dark.~

Rumor from Volo: The word is, that all across the expansive Sword Coast, from the Cloudpeaks to Baldur's Gate, an ore shortage is severely crippling local trade.  Bandits -purportedly both human AND demihuman- raid caravans, whilst ore reaching its destination becomes brittle and useless following smelting, strangely afflicted by an odd, iron-weakening  plague.  As though this were not cause for alarm in itself, production at the mine outside of Nashkel has fallen, with the substantially lower yields being blamed on nervous workers.  Mysterious disappearances of several miners have set the whole area on edge, where something must shift the balance to one side, or the other.~

//TERSUS.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - @20170 - 5*/
@310541 = ~Bandits!

I've learned something interesting from a hobgoblin stockboy, though I'm not sure what it all might mean. The bandit camp is apparently composed of two separate groups: the predominantly hobgoblin Chill and Black Talon, the human faction. What could bring such different groups together, I don't yet know. Money is the obvious motivation, but how much and who's paying it? Whoever it is, they're obviously not short on coin.~
/*UNSOLVED - @20179 - 6*/
@310542 = ~Bandits!

I've learned something interesting from a hobgoblin stockboy in the bandit camp, today. He wasn't quite sure who was funding this whole operation but his guesses leaned towards either the Zhentarim or a new group, the Iron Throne. I don't know much about the latter, so I had best keep my eyes peeled and my ear to the ground. If I ever need leather armor, though, I know a hobgoblin stockboy who'd only be too eager to serve.~
//TRANZI.DLG

@310544 = ~Bandits!

I fought Tranzig in Feldepost's Inn in Beregost. I suspected that he was in league with the bandits and might know the locations of their camp. I thought he might be more forthcoming with information if I showed him I meant business.~
/*UNSOLVED - @11647 - 7*/

I pressured Tranzig and he said he was a messenger for the bandits. His job was to deliver messages between someone named Tazok and the now-deceased Mulahey.~

@310451 = ~A talking chicken.

Today I met the madman, Kissiq. He seems quite obsessed and disturbed by his supposed encounter with a talking chicken. While I doubt his sanity, I find the lure of such adventure rather hard to suppress. He claimed that the chicken lay to the east of him, should I ever choose to investigate this further.~
//MELICA.DLG

I must bring a skull back to Thalantyr, so he can try to restore Melicamp to a human form.~
/*SOLVED - @10670 - 28*/
@310454 = ~A talking chicken.

I brought a skull back to Thalantyr as he requested, but his attempt to restore Melicamp was unfortunately a failure. Apparently the young man's body could not stand the shock of transformation again. Thalantyr said there was nothing we could have done to have changed the outcome, it was simply a matter of luck. Magic remains an uncertain force, and care must be taken in its use.~
/*SOLVED - @10671 - 32*/
@310455 = ~A talking chicken.

I brought a skull back to Thalantyr as he requested, and his attempt to restore Melicamp was a success. The young man's body withstood the strain of transformation again, and he seems eager to learn from his mistakes.  Thalantyr cautioned that a tragic ending was just as likely, and that care should always be taken in the use of magic, no matter how benign it seems.~
/*SOLVED - new*/
@310805 = ~A talking chicken.

I have taken Melicamp the chicken to Thalantyr at High Hedge.  I do not wish to see how the poor wizard turns out, not because I hold anything against him.  Rather, Thalantyr's rather insulting demeanour leaves me no choice.~

An enslaved miner has told us that there's a way to destroy the Iron Throne mine in the Cloakwood.  An obsidian plug blocks the flow of an underground river.  If the plug were released, the water would flood the entire mine.  Only the master of the mines has the key to the plug.~

The dwarf Yeslick has told us a great deal about the Cloakwood mines.  He and his clan used to work in the mines, but they dug into an underground river.  In the ensuing flood, most of Yeslick's clan died.  Yeslick later met the man known as Rieltar, an important figure in the Iron Throne.  With Yeslick's help Reiltar reopened the mines for the Iron Throne.  Yeslick tells us that a mage called Davaeorn runs the mines from the fourth level.  If we were to get a key from him we could flood the entire mine site.~

I killed the ogres that Sarhedra mentioned. Upon reporting this to her, however, she got so flustered trying to think of something more I could do for her that she forgot to give me my reward. Ah well, a few dead ogres is reward enough, I suppose.~

I will keep an eye out for them.~
/*SOLVED - @11882 - 5*/

He and his team have discovered an underground settlement of an ancient primitive people, and are close to entering one of the inner chambers of the site.  However, they have been at the mercy of bandits who have have not stolen anything, but have attempted to sabotage the expedition and have even resorted to kidnapping.  I have agreed to keep watch and protect these intellectual folk from such attacks.  Hopefully, if these diggers make a breakthrough, I may find something rather unique for my efforts.~

I found an excavation site far west of Nashkel being explored by Charleston Nib.  I was not interested in such boring history.~

@310577 = ~Archaeological dig.

It seems that the excavation has made a rather tragic turn.  Apparently, a cursed idol in the inner chamber caused madness in the diggers and I had no choice but to defend myself.  Charleston Nib's days are probably over with this predicament.  The tomb will be forever sealed and will not be disturbed again, so I hope...~

I have been promised riches to rid of Charleston Nib's entire team and to recover some magical treasure from the excavation site far west of Nashkel.

Hurgan hadn't told us everything when he sent us to retrieve the dagger. It appears that the dagger contains the soul of an evil demon that killed Hurgan's grandfather.

Fenrus Boulon has told us that Durlag's Tower was built by a famous dwarven hero name Durlag Trollkiller.

The tower, and labyrinth below, was built ages ago by the dwarven hero Durlag "Thunderaxe," for no less worthy a purpose than to be a home for him and his kin. His enormous fortune occupied entire rooms, rumored waist-deep on a man. The wealth Durlag accumulated was to be the backbone of his clan.~

The stories of Durlag's opulence spread across the land, and the most unsavory of creatures sought to make the tower theirs.

I had just begun exploring Durlag's Tower when I met a man by the name of Bayard. He seemed calm, though this place had frightened him and he was choosing to leave. Apparently his party are still within, having decided to go on without him. He wished them well, but would not follow. The traps and 'tests' left by Durlag are beyond his ability, or so he seemed to think. Some are extremely lethal, offering no second chance to a trespasser. This place is not meant to hinder, but to kill. He is also afraid of the creature that has taken up residence here. It is apparently a 'Demon Knight,' some type of fell servant from the lower planes that is supposedly extremely powerful. Bayard feels that attacking such a creature directly is tantamount to suicide. Perhaps his fear will serve him well, but I must go onward. I shall keep an eye out for these 'ward stones' that he mentioned as well. They must be keys of a sort.~

I met a woman in the lower portion of Durlag's Tower. She was apparently part of another group of adventurers that were all wiped out. She says it was a Demonknight that killed them; a hellishly powerful form of undead. She also said it employed a strange magic to defeat her friends: something involving a "Mirror of Opposition," or a related type of device. It created duplicates of the party and they were forced to kill themselves. Appropriate I suppose, what with the way Durlag's Tower originally fell.

@310624 = ~Investigate Durlag's Tower.

I met a woman in the lower portion of Durlag's Tower. She was apparently part of another group of adventurers that were all wiped out. She says it was a Demonknight that killed them; a hellishly powerful form of undead. She also said it employed a strange magic to defeat her friends: something involving a "Mirror of Opposition," or a related type of device. It created duplicates of the party and they were forced to kill themselves. Appropriate I suppose, what with the way Durlag's Tower originally fell. She suggested that I try to turn the mirror on the Demonknight itself, though this would assuredly expose the rest of the room as well. I think I will fare better with a direct assault. She seemed to think otherwise.~

Clair seemed rather amazed that I defeated the demonknight. Perhaps so was I. A pity her friends could not be saved. A harsh lesson about knowing your boundaries.  When I finish my other quests in Ulgoth's Beard, I should report my victory to the messenger.~

@310638 = ~Investigate Durlag's Tower.

Clair seemed rather amazed that I defeated the demonknight, and perhaps so was I. She was also happy that at least one of her friends made it out alive.

I have encountered a phantom...perhaps of Durlag himself. It said that the true spirit of Durlag passed long ago, but his hatred and fear that built the tower still maintains it. It said I must understand two of the 'paths' that led to this place. After that, 'the way' will become clear. It seems to want something as well. It said there was a new evil here, something not a part of the tower that must be expelled. I don't fancy being this creature's lackey, but I may have no choice...unless I just leave.~

I bought a ward token from that scoundrel Galken, and I should have guessed there would be strings attached.

I encountered a ghoul of great power, named Grael. He offered a warning about something called a Tanar'ri, and the horrible 'death-gaze' it wields. A 'gaze that is not a gaze.' Sounds more insidious than even the gaze of the basilisk. I wonder if the traditional precautions will even function against it? I shall keep this in mind, though I doubt I will meet such a creature.

The more he has, the less it seems
He becomes a slave
Of glittering things
Yet I hunger - Feed me that which glitters beyond all else.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What glittering thing could this warder wish of me? Gold? A gem? I must solve this riddle to pass.~

Trembling and weeping
Unable to lift a hand in his own defense
Yet I sleep - Awaken me.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What will awaken this warder? Perhaps  a loud noise like a drum or a gong. Perhaps something else. I must solve this riddle to pass.~

I curse him with trust and respect
I slow the blade in its course
By stealing his passion for blood
And offering a softer emotion in return
Yet I thirst for more - Give me the sweet crimson drink of laughter and passion.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What does this warder thirst for? What drink is commonly associated with passion and where on this level would it make sense to find or make such a drink? I must solve this riddle to pass.~
/*SOLVED - @24051 - 2*/
@310636 = ~Investigate Durlag's Tower: Riddles.

I am the warriors fate
I raise him above his brethren
I amplify his deeds
He becomes scornful, where once he had respect
He becomes a giant, where once he was a man.
Yet I lack the proper honor - Raise me up in glory
Through the chronicles of my deeds, pride shall be honored
Through the passing of knowledge my sword shall display my glory
Then you shall know that I am well pleased

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What would honor this warder?  What will cause his sword, his Pride, to show his glory. He mentions chronicles of deeds. Obviously I must find and read these chronicles. The trick is in finding them. What could Durlag have intended with this puzzle? I must solve it to pass.~

//MENDA4.DLG
/*SOLVED - @23410 - 3,5*/
@310675 = ~Mendas and Balduran's expedition.

The mystery of this island has become clear. Mendas/Selaad sent us to the island on the false pretenses of retrieving evidence from what was believed to be Balduran's shipwreck. It was indeed the adventurer's ship, though his personal fate yet remains a mystery. Balduran's crew were infected with lycanthropy sometime during that fateful voyage. The ship was beached and wrecked leaving the two strains of lycanthropes, werwolves and wolfweres to fight amongst themselves for survival. The more organized werewolves built the village that we recently shipwrecked near on our own fateful voyage. The chaotic wolfweres took residence in the ruins of Balduran's ship and both packs survived in uneasy co-existence since then. Mendas/Selaad eventually took the risk of sailing for the mainland. Somehow he made it and, upon discovering that someone had finally found the island, made up a plausible tale and had us first steal the sea charts, and later travel to the island to put them in his werewolf mate's hands. She had us kill the wolfwere's and then infected the party with lycanthropy, intending us to join the pack or die fighting. We killed her, took the charts and sailed home to finally discover the truth of Mendas' duplicity. Fate seems to enjoy toying with me.~

One thing I do know is that I am stranded on this mysterious island with apparently gentle folk, and that the aching pain in my head is nowhere near subsiding.

I have met the village historian, a woman by the name of Delainy. I found her company tedious, but I have agreed to help her with a small problem she was having. It seems that an important symbol for her village, a cloak, blew away from the chieftain's hut in the recent storm. It is probably outside the walls, so I shall have to watch out for the 'beasts' that the locals keep mentioning. Hopefully this will not take too much time.~

Delainy led me to a secret path from the chieftain's hut. There is a ship that the werewolves have built, but they needed the seacharts to safely escape. The secret door is in the north of the hut. It was always there, but was magically sealed. Kaishas has gone through, so now it is accessible. Delainy has stayed behind to fight for me. She has proven a friend and ally...I wish...~

//Retrieve Shandalar's cloak.
//SHANDAL2.DLG
/*UNSOLVED - new*/
@310793 = ~Retrieve Shandalar's cloak.

It seems that my dealings with the Thieves' Guild have no gone unnoticed: Shandalar, who had three daughters protecting components of a skyship, has lured me into punishment for their deaths.  He has teleported me to a mysterious, but chilly, island, in the middle of a desolate ocean!  Shandalar mentioned a cloak that I had to find.  Such a piece of clothing might be the key out of this accursed place.  I will have to keep my eyes peeled for it.~
/*UNSOLVED - new*/
@310809 = ~Retrieve Shandalar's cloak.

I have been unwillingly forced into a task for an impolite mage at the centre of Ulgoth's Beard.  The twit has sent me off to a barren, icy island to find a ragged cloak of his.  It is probably his mistake to grant me passage back, with a wardstone he gave me, as I am tempted to stuff the head of a mace into his mouth when I return to him.~
/*UNSOLVED - new*/
@310810 = ~Retrieve Shandalar's cloak.

I have accepted an apparently simple task of retrieving a cloak for Shandalar, a mage I encountered at Ulgoth's Beard.  Apparently simple, but bedazzling, I find myself on some strange secluded reef in the middle of an icy ocean!  That trickster has imprisoned me on this eyesore, as I am sure he said something about release, but I am relieved that I am in possession of a wardstone that will effect it.  I should find this cloak quickly - it is getting very cold indeed.~
/*SOLVED - new*/
@310811 = ~Retrieve Shandalar's cloak.

I am glad to see the back of Shandalar's incantations, and his cloak as well.  The icy prison that I was transported to was no place for strangers on a little errand.  I should be careful of conspicuous mages standing out in the open from now on.~
/*SOLVED - new*/
@310812 = ~Retrieve Shandalar's cloak.

That dastardly man of a mage escaped me before I could reap my own reward for the useless adventure he sent me to!  The last thing I shall do is to heed his  criticism of my manner.  Regardless, I am glad to see the back of him, his cloak, and that icy prison.~
/*SOLVED - new*/
@310813 = ~Retrieve Shandalar's cloak.

I retrieved Shandalar's cloak from what seemed to be an icy prison.  I certainly do not want to go back there again, as it sends chills down my spine.  I should count myself lucky that he gave me a wardstone to find my way back to Ulgoth's Beard.  I would not want to encounter him in the future, lest he enact further punishment for the death of his daughters.  I am glad to see the back of him, his cloak, and that icy prison.~

Indeed, they seem almost frightened whenever he approaches them and tries to catch their eye... As of yet, I cannot fathom the relevance of this to my investigation.

He DID confirm what I already knew: that the masters behind the bandits likely have a base in the Cloakwood forest.~

Again Elminster has made an appearance, though he was a little more forthcoming with information this time. He apparently knew Gorion well, and thought him a good man to care for me. He also spoke of bad blood, and a taint that will consume me if care is not taken. What this means, I am not sure. I will heed his warning, though I have little time to dwell on it. He did give me some names though, of people he feels are trustworthy: Scar of the Flaming Fist and Duke Eltan. I suppose I can believe them if Elminster himself does so recommend.~

//Rumor from Volo.
//VOLO.DLG
/*JOURNAL - @8534*/
@310444 = ~Rumor from Volo.

Many a story have I collected from across this great realm, though sometimes I am at a loss whether to believe them or not, due to their extraordinary circumstance.  Such a tale is this, wherein lies the story of a band of hearty adventurers moving amidst the shadows of the land, effecting change where it is needed.  I was enjoying the simple fare of the celebrations in Nashkel, when the strangest news hit the town.  It would seem the mines, long plagued by unexplained deaths, had been inundated by a horde of ill mannered kobolds, under the direction of a rather unscrupulous and hygienically suspect cleric of Cyric.  Dispatching the villain with appropriate brevity, the heroes freed the mine, and are the sole reason for the trickle of iron finally winding its way to the Gate now.  None seem to recall their names, but the consensus agrees they were great of stature, and cut an impressive figure across the plains.~
/*JOURNAL - @8535*/
@310445 = ~Rumor from Volo.

Stranger tales I have told, but none are as fresh in my mind as this one, which is also fresh from the happening as well!  It would seem that the orchestrators of the ever vexing iron shortage supplied themselves and their allies with ore mined from a secret location, and while the coast was in turmoil they built quite the powerbase at the aforementioned mine.  A group of heroes, for they can only be called such, lay siege to the encampment and ultimately flooded out the evil conspirators in a rushing torrent of water and justice, though not before securing the release of some several dozen enslaved workers.  A serious blow, I am sure, to whatever fiendish plot is brewing in our fair land.~

Stranger tales I have told, but none are as fresh in my mind as this one, which is also fresh from the happening as well!  It would seem that the orchestrators of the ever vexing iron shortage supplied themselves and their allies with ore mined from a secret location, and while the coast was in turmoil they built quite the powerbase at the aforementioned mine.  A mysterious group of battle-veteran strangers, for I hesitate to call them heroes, lay siege to the encampment and ultimately flooded out the evil conspirators in a rushing torrent of water and justice,  though every slave to the man was lost in the drenching.  'Twould seem they didn't wish to encumber themselves, though I imagine the weight of those dead souls must be nigh unto horrific.  The question to pose then, is whether the devil you know is better than the devil you don't.  We shall wait and see what comes of this.~
/*JOURNAL - @8537*/
@310447 = ~Rumor from Volo.

Some tales defy all logic or explanation when posed to the sane mind, and it is a story just so that I give to you now.  Much of it is already known, due to the celebrity of those involved, though many may find it truly shocking how deep the seeds of destruction were sown.  Beloved Sarevok, a man among men, set to all but rule the coast, was actually a core architect of the very iron shortage that so unraveled the economy of the land, and had a hand in the poisoning of Duke Eltan that directly led to his rise to power.  We were but seconds away from the first step down that path when from the shadows again stepped the unknown group of my previous tales.  None can say definitively what happened next, though it is certain that Sarevok was pursued to the very bottom of the undercity, and from there he did not return.  I'll wager many would just as soon have seen him chased to the 9th plane itself, as he hurt many of the folk of the land, both direct and indirect.~

"Hand over your ward," the armored fiend had said. He was after you and you alone, but why?  If only Gorion had given some clue, but now you are alone and lost.

Throughout the Sword Coast and in Baldur's Gate, especially.

But that's not what's important -- where there's one, there's many. It's a question of whom else they've claimed... and how long before they come for me. The one said something about a plan -- I am to be framed for the murder of Rieltar, head of the Iron Throne's operations on the Sword Coast. He must be here, then, somewhere in the Central Keep.
