@0     = ~Someone disturbs me?! I have no time to talk with you, <CHARNAME>. Don't take it personally; I'm just a very busy man.~
@1     = ~Why hast thou disturbed me here? Hast thou no manners? Get out!~
@2     = ~So, <CHARNAME>, you have sullied your father's name by defiling his home and bringing ruin to a peace that has lasted for centuries. I spit on you and all of your friends. Your transgressions will be punished in the most severe form. I formally accuse you of the murders of Brunos Costak and Rieltar Anchev.~
@3     = ~Why have I accused you? You were seen fleeing the murder scene. Koveras found the identifying ring of a Shadow Thief assassin in your personal effects, and gold minted in Amn. I feel that it is strong enough proof to accuse you.~
@4     = ~You were seen fleeing the site of the murder by the guest known as Koveras.~
@5     = ~From everything we have seen and found, it is not hard to figure what your purpose was. From what I have been told, you have been trying to place all the misfortune of the Sword Coast squarely on the shoulders of the Iron Throne. I assume you and your friends are assassins in the employ of Amn. Perhaps you were sent up north to create discord in the region before an Amnian invasion. It matters little; you and your friends are to be sent to Baldur's Gate where an appropriate punishment will be administered.~
@6     = ~But I have done nothing wrong! Why have you accused me of such a thing?~
@7     = ~Fine. Do your worst, you old coot!~
@8     = ~But I have done nothing wrong! Why have you accused me of such a thing?~
@9     = ~I am pleased to see thee again. Hast thou come to collect the inheritance from your father? He left thee several items, all of which are within his old room. Please forgive my abrupt nature, but much requires my attention this day. It is important that we later speak of your foster father, but not now. Meet me in the outer grounds later today.~
@10    = ~Surrender to the guard, young one. Thou wouldst only make it worse for thyself.~
@11    = ~Hello, young one. I am sorry to see thee in such terrible circumstances. I know thee well enough to see that you have been falsely accused. Tomorrow Ulraunt will most likely sentence thee to be sent to Baldur's Gate. There, thou wouldst receive the death penalty for these actions. I know that Gorion would not want to see his only child killed a scant few weeks after his own death. 'Tis as a favor to his memory that I will help thee escape. Make thy way through the catacombs beneath the library, but disturb them not. I have your possessions with me. You must take them and go with haste.~
@12    = ~I know of no one named Koveras, but Koveras is the reverse of Sarevok, a young man who accompanied the leaders of the Iron Throne when they first came. I know not where he has gone.~
@13    = ~Do you know anyone by the name of Koveras?~
@14    = ~Thank you for helping us.~
@15    = ~Gorion has been looking for thee, young one.~
@16    = ~First off, let me introduce myself. I'm Scar, second-in-command of the Flaming Fist. Though it is not necessary for you to reveal your names, please answer me this: Are you the group that was involved in the trouble at the Nashkel mines?~
@17    = ~Ahhh, nope.~
@18    = ~Yes, that was us.~
@19    = ~I hope you're telling the truth, though it doesn't really matter. You're free to go. If you ever have any trouble or change your minds about your identity, you can find me outside of the Flaming Fist compound.~
@20    = ~Well, I have to say you've made quite the commotion up here in Baldur's Gate. I can't really put my finger on a single source, but there have been many strange happenings going on within the city. It's been getting harder and harder for me to put trust in someone. I need outsiders to do some investigations, people with no connections to anyone within the city. Would you be interested in working for me in such a capacity?~
@21    = ~We really don't have the time or the inclination.~
@22    = ~If it pays well, sure.~
@23    = ~I'm sorry to hear that. You're free to go. If you ever have any trouble, or if you change your mind about helping me, you can find me outside the Flaming Fist compound.~
@24    = ~All right then. What I'm about to tell you must be held in the strictest confidence. Do you understand? I need you to begin an investigation of the Seven Suns trading coster. The Seven Suns leadership has been acting strangely of late. They've been selling off valuable assets and neglecting many of their more profitable trading ventures. Considering the importance that the trading coster holds over the economy of the city, the Grand Dukes are noticeably upset. I've gone to talk to the coster's head, Jhasso. He rudely rebuffed me, telling me to mind my own business. I've known Jhasso for many years, and this isn't his usual behavior. I can't start up an official investigation, as there is no real reason for doing so. That's why I need you.~
@25    = ~We're ready to start, tell us what we need to do and how much money you'll pay us to do it.~
@26    = ~We're ready to go for it, but there's something you need to know first: We think that the Iron Throne may be behind recent events along the coast. At the mines in Nashkel and in Cloakwood, we've learned much about the goals and methods of the Iron Throne, and it doesn't bode well for the future of this region.~
@27    = ~Well, that sheds new light on things. There's nothing I can really do about it now, but I'll make sure to look into it.~
@28    = ~I want you to break into the Seven Suns compound and find out what's wrong. Use stealth in your investigations; I don't want this operation to cause too much fuss. The most important person to watch for is Jhasso. Once you've found out as much as possible, report back to me at the Flaming Fist compound. I'll pay you 2,000 gold for this favor.~
@29    = ~The estate is located on the southwest side of town. I wish all of you the best of luck. Remember, once you're done at the Seven Sun's estate, it's imperative that you meet me at the Flaming Fist barracks, which are just west of the Seven Suns.~
@30    = ~~
@31    = ~I am glad to see you have returned. So what news do you bring me?~
@32    = ~We didn't learn anything, sorry. Do you have anything else for us to do?~
@33    = ~According to one of the merchants we met, the Seven Suns has been infiltrated by some sort of shapeshifter. I don't know what kind of monsters they are, but the merchants are fearful.~
@34    = ~Doppelgangers had taken over many of the higher echelons of the coster. The monsters are all dead now, slain by us.~
@35    = ~That's too bad. Hopefully it only means that my fears were misplaced. I want to discuss some of the fears I have about the Iron Throne. I'll be waiting just outside the doors of the Flaming Fist barracks. Whenever you have time, come talk to me.~
@36    = ~This is very serious news. I must ask you another favor. If you were to return to the compound and destroy this infestation of monsters, I would be willing to double your wage.~
@37    = ~Sorry, we've had enough to do with the Seven Suns. If you have any information about the Iron Throne, we'd like to discuss that instead.~
@38    = ~Sure we can go back, but the reward better be worth it.~
@39    = ~All right then, if you'd rather discuss the Iron Throne, then I'm perfectly willing. I have some paperwork to do, then you can meet with me outside of the Flaming Fist barracks.~
@40    = ~I must thank you once again; you're doing a great service to this city.~
@41    = ~You have done very well! I will be doubling your wages for the heroic service you have provided to this city. We must keep in touch; I may need your help in investigating the Iron Throne.~
@42    = ~Back so soon! How did your battle fare?~
@43    = ~We don't think we will be able to defeat all of the doppelgangers.~
@44    = ~The doppelgangers are all dead. Jhasso is back in control of the business.~
@45    = ~We killed all the doppelgangers, but we weren't able to save Jhasso.~
@46    = ~That's understandable. The creatures you have described are a very dangerous breed, IF they are the monsters I think they are. You'll still get an extra 2,000 gold, and you need not worry about retaliation from these creatures; I'll be sending in a detachment of the Flaming Fist to deal with them. Unfortunately, using this kind of strong-arm tactic on the city's premier merchant coster will bring down a lot of trouble on my head.~
@47    = ~I'm impressed! You are as good as your word and obviously very deadly in your work. I'll give you the wage you deserve, triple our original agreement. I want to keep in touch with you, especially if the Iron Throne is up to what you say it is.~
@48    = ~It is sad that a good man like Jhasso had to die, but I am impressed that you defeated all of those horrible creatures. You are a fine group of warriors and worth every bit that I'm about to pay you. We have to keep in touch, especially if the Iron Throne is as underhanded as you say it is.~
@49    = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>. I have another job for you. This one involves a group you have dealt with in the past—the Iron Throne. Duke Eltan himself wishes to speak to you about this. Will you come with me?~
@50    = ~Sorry, we have other things on our mind right now.~
@51    = ~Of course we'll come, especially if we have an audience with the Grand Duke.~
@52    = ~Greetings, I am Scar, second-in-command of the Flaming Fist. My commander, Grand Duke Eltan, has expressed an interest in meeting with you. It has to do with your previous involvement with the Iron Throne.~
@53    = ~We can't come at the moment. There are other, more important, matters at hand.~
@54    = ~Show us the way to this "Grand Duke."~
@55    = ~Perhaps you don't understand the importance of your invitation. One of the Grand Dukes has requested an audience. It would be embarrassing for both of us for you not to show up.~
@56    = ~Well, now that you put it that way, I guess we'll come along.~
@57    = ~Sorry, our minds are made up.~
@58    = ~I'll return to you later to see if you've changed your minds.~
@59    = ~Just follow me, I'll take you to the Flaming Fist compound. The Grand Duke is waiting for us.~
@60    = ~~
@61    = ~I've come back to see if you've changed your minds about seeing the duke.~
@62    = ~We hold by our earlier decision.~
@63    = ~Okay, take us to your Duke.~
@64    = ~The duke really wants your assistance in these matters, so I'll return again in case you decide to be more reasonable.~
@65    = ~Let me introduce you to Grand Duke Eltan, one of the lords of the city, commander of the Flaming Fist, and member of the Lord's Alliance.~
@66    = ~I have another job you might be interested in. You'll be well paid for your services. Care to hear more?~
@67    = ~We don't have time for another job right now. We'd rather discuss the Iron Throne. Do you have any information on them?~
@68    = ~We're always interested in more work. What does it entail?~
@69    = ~Greetings, mercenaries. I'm Scar, second-in-command of the Flaming Fist, the city's standing army. You haven't been in our city for too long, have you? Well, if you're looking for a job, I have one that might get your interest. Do you want to hear more?~
@70    = ~We're not interested.~
@71    = ~Sure, tell us some more.~
@72    = ~All right then, meet me outside of the Flaming Fist barracks and we can discuss the Iron Throne.~
@73    = ~The problem is this: Every night people have been disappearing from the streets of the city. My men have been scouring the city trying to find the culprit, but so far to no avail. People have begun to get scared, and very few are willing to leave their homes at night. Something has to be done, and quickly. Would you be willing to take the job? I'd pay you 300 gold in advance with a 1,000 gold bonus if you discover what's been happening with the disappearing citizens. What do you say?~
@74    = ~We have other things to do.~
@75    = ~We agree to your terms.~
@76    = ~Your job is really simple. All I want you to do is patrol the east of the city and find an entrance to the sewers. Perhaps you'll get lucky and find out what's been happening. If you do find out what's been happening, come to see me at the Flaming Fist barracks. Our only clue so far has led us to the sewers, so if you want to explore them first, it would probably be a good idea. Also, we've found tracks of some many-legged creature, perhaps a centipede-like monster.~
@77    = ~It's good to see you again. How have things gone?~
@78    = ~Sorry, we failed to learn anything.~
@79    = ~We learned that an ogre mage holed up in the sewers was responsible for all the disappearances. He had several carrion crawlers that would steal out at night to carry off random victims. The crawlers used their hapless prey as food, while the ogre mage took any valuables they might have.~
@80    = ~A crazed ogre mage was sending off his pet carrion crawlers to kill innocent victims. For what purpose, we cannot say.~
@81    = ~You've done a good job and earned your bonus in full. Do you have any of the items possessed by the ogre's victims? I'm sure their families would like to have something to remember of their loved ones. We know for a fact that the Sashenstar family lost a daughter to those creatures. She had a signet ring, a ring inset with a ruby.~
@82    = ~Sorry, we didn't find anything.~
@83    = ~Yes, we did. We'll happily return it.~
@84    = ~That's too bad. Well, I'm going to need some people to do some investigating of the Iron Throne. I'm just going to finish up some paperwork, then I'll be just outside the main doors of the Flaming Fist compound. If you wish to discuss the Iron Throne, just come talk to me there.~
@85    = ~I thank you for your honesty. I'll throw in a 3,000 gold bonus for the return of the items. Anyway, I'm going to need some people to do some investigating of the Iron Throne. I'm just going to finish up some paperwork, then I'll be just outside the main doors of the Flaming Fist compound. If you wish to discuss the Iron Throne, just come talk to me there.~
@86    = ~All those poor people... I'm glad you were able to stop the ogre mage. You have earned your bonus. Anyway, I'm going to need some people to do some investigating of the Iron Throne. I'm just going to finish up some paperwork, then I'll be just outside the main doors of the Flaming Fist compound. If you wish to discuss the Iron Throne, just come talk to me there.~
@87    = ~Well, what are you doing here? Keep on your nightly patrols and come back once you've found something. If you feel that you're having no luck, then come and talk to me, and I'll reassign the mission to someone else. I have something else of importance that you might be interested in. It involves the Iron Throne.~
@88    = ~That's okay, I'll send one of my squads to see if they can find anything out. Anyway, I have another mission for you. I'm going to need some people to do some investigating of the Iron Throne. I'm just going to finish up some paperwork, then I'll be just outside the main doors of the Flaming Fist compound. If you wish to discuss the Iron Throne, just come talk to me there.~
@89    = ~Before you leave, I must congratulate you. It takes brave people to battle the foul denizens you have described. As well, I'm going to need some people to do some investigating of the Iron Throne. I'm just going to finish up some paperwork, then I'll be just outside the main doors of the Flaming Fist compound. If you wish to discuss the Iron Throne, just come talk to me there.~
@90    = ~Go to Gorion and listen well, for without knowledge, life is a mere shadow of death.~
@91    = ~Uhh... yes, son, it certainly has been a long time. How are you doing... my boy?~
@92    = ~Um, yes... it's Mom, and I want you to stop all this zombie foolishness and come to Beregost with me. Surely someone there can help you.~
@93    = ~Uuuuuuuuuhhhh..................~ [ZOMBI01]
@94    = ~I am pleased to see that you have taken time to pay tribute to wise Oghma.~
@95    = ~Hhhhhhhhhhhh.............................~
@96    = ~It's madness! By what logic do you steal mine parents' visage and attack my family?! You shall die for this!~
@97    = ~No matter. I've not seen you since... um... Zhentil Keep. Thank the gods we all got out safely.~
@98    = ~No matter. I've not seen you since... um... Zhentil Keep. Thank the gods we all got out safely.~
@99    = ~But these are not our kin! What madness has your eyes? Zombies all!~
@100   = ~I am disappointed in you, son. These are not your family, and it's an abomination to suggest it!~
@101   = ~It's not I who lies, but you to yourself! You rob others of THEIR loved ones to replace those you betrayed long ago!~
@102   = ~Indeed. I can offer you healing potions, if you wish, as a token of goodwill.~
@103   = ~You do not trust us?~
@104   = ~Now Montaron, had I just been attacked I might be leery as well. So be it, I shall not heal you.~
@105   = ~Stop a second there, young'n, 'cuz I heard what you gone and done for old Brun. It made me ashamed that I didn't try to help him myself. Good to know there's still someone willin' ta go the extra mile, even for a stranger. I want you to have this heirloom of mine, because of what you did. Now my heirs didn't loom so big, but you ought to get more use out o' it than my mantle does. Folks like you make a jaded old man think there's still decent people out there.~
@106   = ~Stop a second there, young 'un, 'cuz I heard what you gone and done for old Brun. It made me ashamed that I didn't try to help him myself. Good to know there's still someone willin' to go the extra mile, even for a stranger. I want you to have this heirloom of mine, because of what you did. Now my heirs didn't loom so big, but you ought to get more use out o' it than my mantle does. Folks like you make a jaded old man think there's still decent people out there.~
@107   = ~An interesting piece o' material you got there. Ankheg, if I'm not mistaken. Been a while since I seen the like, but if I remember correctly, it makes a fine set of armor. If properly treated it's comparable to full plate with half the weight! If you're willing to part with your shells I'll give you 500 gold for the lot of them. No more can I offer with business as slow as it is. Iron shortage hurting us all.~
@108   = ~Hold, Montaron, this young wayfarer is in need. Someone has set about thee, stranger, and you have barely escaped with your life.~
@109   = ~A child wandering the wilderness? Surely you must be none too bright to be traveling these roads.~
@110   = ~An exhausted whelp in the forest?~
@111   = ~You should find your father, for he wouldst speak with you.~
@112   = ~Heh heh.~
@113   = ~It is good to see you again. The libraries are yours to use for the duration of your stay. Let me show you to your hostel room.~
@114   = ~Greetings, I hope you find the resources at our library to be adequate. Let me show you to your hostel rooms.~
@115   = ~Before I take you to your hostel rooms you should understand that I want no trouble. I hope that is understood.~
@116   = ~There are several rules that need be adhered to, of which you are no doubt aware. First, you are prohibited from taking any of the books from their respective rooms. Second, certain rooms will be inscribed with a rune, and are not to be entered. Third, you are not to stay within the confines of Candlekeep for more than ten days. Now follow me; I'll take you to your quarters.~
@117   = ~Hey ho there, fellow travelers! You look to be wanderers of the adventuring sort. Tell me, what direction calls you?~
@118   = ~Stop and surrender yourself. You are accused of murdering the men Brunos Costak, Thaldorn Tenhevich and Rieltar Anchev. If you give yourself up now, you will be assured of a fair trial.~
@119   = ~I am proceeding in a northerly direction this day.~
@120   = ~I am heading south for a time, though that may change.~
@121   = ~I am heading south for a time, though that may change.~
@122   = ~I am heading south for a time, though that may change.~
@123   = ~It is the same for me! Surely this lends us a familial bond of sorts. The smart move would be to travel as one, especially with the number of bandits in the area. You probably need the counterbalance of my intelligence as well.~
@124   = ~Ah, my loutish friends, that is my direction too. Fate has crossed our paths, and we could all benefit by traveling together. It will be the classic pairing of you, the stalwart adventurers, and I, the intelligent one. How could you refuse?~
@125   = ~Oh no, not my way at all. Nevertheless, since you are so obviously in need of guidance from someone with... not quite so much orcish heritage, I shall alter my course and come with you. Don't bother to thank me; just grunt approval.~
@126   = ~Well, I suppose I'll be on my way then you idi— You said YES! I mean, of course I'll come with you. My intellect and skill as a cleric will undoubtedly make your group much better than it is. Onward.~
@127   = ~I should have guessed by your knuckle-dragging gait and minuscule nose; you're a complete and utter moron, aren't ya?~
@128   = ~I suppose there would be no harm in your joining me.~
@129   = ~No, and don't call me Shirley.~
@130   = ~Whatever. Come if ye must, but watch your mouth.~
@131   = ~How could I refuse? Watch me. Taketh thou a hike!~
@132   = ~Uhhhh HUH. If you must.~
@133   = ~Thou art a dink, to be sure. Get lost.~
@134   = ~I am proceeding in a northerly direction this day.~

@143   = ~Please, will no one help me? Anyone? I've nowhere else to be turnin'. I beseech thee, kind <SIRMAAM>, please help. It's strange happenings at my farm, and I've not the strength I once had. I've nothing to offer, and even if I did I doubt such as you would have need of it. Please.~
@144   = ~Please, will no one help me? Anyone? I've nowhere else to be turnin'. Please, you're young and strapping, can you lend a neighbor a hand? There's somethin' going on at my farm and I can't afford to hire help. I've nothing to offer you, save my gratitude.~
@145   = ~Please, will no one help me? Anyone? I've nowhere else to be turnin'. I'm not the kind to be hiring mercenaries, and neither can I afford it, but I need your aid. Please, out of the goodness of your hearts, can you help an old man?~
@146   = ~Because of this damnable iron shortage it cost the last of my savings to repair the plow. I've nothing left but my son Nathan, and now he is missing. By Chauntea, it was hard enough just asking for help! Please!~
@147   = ~You need look no further for aid. What can I do?~
@148   = ~You need look no further for aid. What can I do?~
@149   = ~You need look no further for aid. What can I do?~

@158   = ~Oh by the Great Mother, thank you! My son Nathan and his friends went looking for our missing cattle, then they just up and disappeared! Been gone for days now and, with all the bandits around, who knows what's happened. I don't know where they were heading, but I saw some sort o' tracks to the west. Please find Nathan. I can't afford to keep the farm without my son.~
@159   = ~I've not been able to find your son, but I'll not stop till I do.~
@160   = ~I can't find him at all. It's beyond me.~
@161   = ~Have you found my son? Is he well?~
@162   = ~Please keep looking. He's out there somewhere, and I must know his fate.~
@163   = ~No... my only son... It is a black day. He died for this farm, but I am too old to work it and too poor to hire someone else. I've lost him AND the land. At least now I know... Thank you for your help but... I wish to be alone now.~
@164   = ~You need look no further for aid. What can I do?~

@172   = ~Tough luck I guess. See ya.~
@173   = ~Well, if it's causin' you strife to hang on to it, I suppose I could... hold it for ya. Thank you, strangers. I don't believe I'll see the likes of you again.~

@179   = ~Tough luck I guess. See ya.~
@180   = ~Ahhh, this will make a fine suit of plate for a governor or better. Nobility like exotic materials and don't care much about the price. Probably close to 20,000 gold for a tenday's work when I'm finished. I may survive this iron shortage after all.~
@181   = ~Whoa! Iron is not so scarce as to make me that desperate! 500 gold or nothing, and you can take it or leave it!~
@182   = ~Suit yourself, but whatever you do with it, I'd do it quick. If not properly dried and cured it will rot in less than a tenday. Be no use to anyone beyond that.~

@184   = ~It's you again. I am afraid I'm no longer interested in the ankheg shell ye possess. I can tell by the sight of it that it's begun to rot. You'll not get 1 gold for it now, let alone 500. What a shame.~
@185   = ~A shame it is. It could bring quite a bit once finished. How about this: For 4,000 gold I'll make it into plate for you instead. It's half my normal rate for working on an exotic, but, as I mentioned, business is slow.~
@186   = ~Good on you. Now it will take me a while to finish, but you will soon have the finest armor in Beregost, if not the entire Sword Coast. Come back in a tenday and I'll have it ready for you.~
@187   = ~It's not ready yet. Perhaps another day or two. Be patient; quality takes time.~
@188   = ~Ahh, you have returned. And here be what I promised you. Beautiful isn't it? A finer set of armor I have not made for some time. Wear it well.~
@189   = ~And gold would be cut like cheese in battle, if you catch my meaning! Bah! Come back with the gold or don't come back! I'll not suffer lip such as this in my own smithy!~
@190   = ~If it be gold you're short of, you may want to try for the bounty on the cleric Bassilus. I hear it already nears 5,000, so you would have change to spare. Be quick about it though. That shell will rot in a tenday if not cured.~
@191   = ~Back again, are you? Well, which will it be? Sell me the shell for 500, or do I make you armor for 4,000?~
@192   = ~I'm not interested in selling it just now, though it would be to you if I do.~
@193   = ~You have just bought yourself some ankheg, sir! A pleasure doing business with you.~
@194   = ~Hardly a fair price for the trouble I went through to get it. Double your offer, and consider it done.~

@202   = ~4,000 gold is ridiculous! It would be cheaper to make it from the gold itself!~
@203   = ~I'll sell it to you. I'm sick of carrying it around.~

@273   = ~At last I am free of my dreary prison. Five and eighty days are far too long for one of the fair folk to live as a dwarf. You look no better off than I, but my appreciation for my liberty bids me add my spells to your cause. I am Xan. Shall we face the impossible together?~
@274   = ~Alas, I was sent to investigate the strange goings-on about this area and I landed caged for seemingly hopeless weeks on end. I have not seen the sun almost as long as I have not seen my home.~
@275   = ~I thank you for my rescue but I must leave quickly. I wish you well in your struggle, though it is surely lost.~
@276   = ~I understand your decision, for the odds are surely insurmountable. I shall return unto Evereska and report of these dire straits.~
@277   = ~I thank you. However ineffective our actions be, I shall not rest until I have made payment to you. If you have searched through Mulahey's treasure, you may have found a sword among his documents. The sword is a moonblade, and it is my most valued possession.~

@295   = ~Greetings. You... you look familiar, though it's not your looks. I am not sure what I expected, but I believe you are Gorion's child. I am Jaheira; this is Khalid.~
@296   = ~It is almost a slight on him, but I see it too.~
@297   = ~We are old friends of your adopted father. He is not with you? I must assume the worst. He would not permit his only child to wander without his accompaniment.~
@298   = ~Gorion often said that he worried for your safety, even at the expense of his own. He also wished that Khalid and I would become your guardians, if he should ever meet an untimely end. However, you are much older now, and the choice of your companions should be your own.~
@299   = ~It would be a fitting last service to Gorion, though we should first go to Nashkel. Khalid and I... look into local concerns, and there are rumors of strange things happening at the mines. No doubt you have heard of the iron shortage? You would do well to help us. It affects everyone, including you. We are to meet the mayor of the town, Berrun Ghastkill.~
@300   = ~Well, good! We'll leave as soon as you're ready, though it should be soon.~
@301   = ~It seems Gorion was a bit generous in his assessment of you, but it's your decision, and I wish you luck on your way.~
@302   = ~Indeed? Interesting. In that case I think we should definitely travel as one. You can never be too careful about the dangers of the open road. Wherever they may spring from.~
@303   = ~Abela~
@304   = ~Albert~
@305   = ~G-good to know you.~

@314   = ~I'm already going to Nashkel. My current companions wish to visit there as well.~
@315   = ~I am... a wanderer of the Realms not unlike thyself, and thou hast caught my notice. I would ask thee a riddle, just as a point of interest for me, and I have a gift if thy answer is correct. My simple test of logic is thus: You have a mother who had four children. Two were twin girls of quiet demeanor, to be named Spring and Summer. The third child, a hellion of a boy, was named Autumn. What was the given name of the fourth and final child?~
@316   = ~Oh... dear. Well then! Don't dawdle in the woods too long, my... young friend. It is dangerous out at night, and I would think that thou would like a FRIENDLY ARM to help GUIDE thee. Yes, <SIRMAAM>, a FRIENDLY ARM IN-deed would be useful. Here's a little something for thy trouble... that thou will undoubtedly encounter. I shall... possibly see thee again in thy travels. Goodbye and... well... good luck.~
@317   = ~Excellent! Basic sensibilities in abundance! I'll not delay thee any longer, for thou art quite capable of the task at hand. Take this potion, though thou may not need it, and go with haste to thy destination. Remember, do not turn down the help of a friendly arm's guidance. I shall see thee again, my friend.~
@318   = ~I congratulate your wise decision. I wish you well for whichever endeavor you now embark upon. However, I must warn you, this woman among you, she is a member of the Shadow Druids. I would not think it prudent to trust such an individual. The Shadow Druids believe in the violent suppression of all forms of civilization.~
@319   = ~Hello again, friend! Thy current path may lead thee to great peril. Be sure that thou hast experienced enough to brave the challenges before thee.~
@320   = ~I'll not go down the mines again! 'Tain't natural what's down there! I just don't understand how adventuring fools like you go and put yourselves in harm's way. I do whatever I can to avoid trouble.~
@321   = ~A dozen men have been lost to the mines. Surely it is a cursed place. I don't believe any of the foreman's excuses, and I don't care about any extra pay. I ain't going near it. You're fools if you go there.~
@322   = ~I paid 35 gold for a sword from Beregost and it "rotted" in my hands! What can disease metal so? Has your gear done the same? Even if you got your blades out of some dank old dungeon, just bringing them near tainted metal makes them weak. Seems like only magic weapons don't degrade, but who has those? No one I know.~
@323   = ~I hear tell of adventurers in town, but they're all talk and no action. If you see them, give 'em a kick and tell 'em to get moving. We need help, and we need it fast.~
@324   = ~Move aside, and I'll be on my way. I have no time to waste on idle blathering. Hard enough making a living without you slowing me down.~
@325   = ~The guard is pathetic! Why, if I had my way, that Brage would have been quartered by now! He's just a man, like any other. A blade delivered in the proper fashion will drop him as simply as his victims!~
@326   = ~<<The player must manually enter the answer. The correct response is their own name.>>~
@327   = ~Incorrect response.~

@329   = ~If the guard cannot protect the miners, the least they could do is find my husband's body! He's been missing for days now, and I just keep getting the runaround. Someone ought to go down there and show them how to take care of business.~
@330   = ~My sister was due from Beregost days ago. I hope she arrives soon. The soldiers say there might be an ogre about. Nasty things, they are. Thankfully they are usually dumb as a sack of hammers. Not that I would say that to one's face, mind you.~
@331   = ~I must speak with the guard. I commissioned a work from the sculptor, but I have not seen him, nor my advance, for over a month. A nice fellow, that Prism, but he should be a little more concerned about the needs of his customers.~
@332   = ~Please, leave me be.~
@333   = ~I'm in no mood for the fair. How can they celebrate after that awful Brage did what he did? I knew that whole family! To think he was captain of the guard.~
@334   = ~That blamed fool merchant wants 30 gold fer a simple iron plow! Never in me born days have I heard the like!~
@335   = ~The blacksmith is all but closed for lack of ore. Ain't nowhere to get my horses shod.~

@338   = ~If the mine production slows any more, we'll all be in the poorhouse. So, would you like a drink?~
@339   = ~Beware the woods to the west, friend, for I hear tell of ogres and madmen. So, would you like a drink?~
@340   = ~Volo's blasted review cut my business in half! I'll take him for a chat out back when next I see him! So, would you like a drink?~

@342   = ~The commander was friend to many before he found that sword. He's not the man he was, by Helm.~
@343   = ~The reward for the commander's head is a king's ransom, but I'll not be lifting MY sword against a brother soldier.~
@344   = ~An entire unit went west after Brage to try to talk some sense to him. It's been a week, and none have returned.~
@345   = ~I am sorry for my mood. All the guard are still grieving the... loss of Commander Brage.~
@346   = ~I'll not believe a man of Brage's rank could kill his own family. 'Twas evil magics of some sort.~
@347   = ~Why are you not at the fair, citizen? 'Tis but a moment's walk east of Nashkel.~
@348   = ~My sword is chipped and tarnished, but we'll not be given new until prices come down.~

@359   = ~Prism carves with unnatural speed; 'tis surely unhealthy.~
@360   = ~My muse shall not speak to such as thee.~
@361   = ~Interested in a little business on the side, friend? I've a man who swears by his grandmother he glimpsed a white wolf up in the Cloudpeak ice fields. It was but a short ways south, and she be easy pickings for a smart sword. I'd pay you good money for its pelt, so it's a guaranteed sale if you go. Keep it in mind on your travels. Can I interest you with anything here in my humble shop?~
@362   = ~A lot of missing livestock lately, but it's puzzling. It's not the bandit's style to be raiding farms.~
@363   = ~I advise you to seek lodging here in Beregost, friend. The roads out are treacherous at best, but the bandits make travel suicide.~
@364   = ~Officially, if you're attacked by any of the raiders, you should give 'em whatever they want. We get fewer leads off of corpses.~
@365   = ~Off the record, if I was attacked by those thieving bandit bastards, I'd shaft 'em good with about three feet o' steel! That would get me a heroes' tombstone!~
@366   = ~Move along, citizen.~
@367   = ~Never have I seen a highwayman that was more interested in iron than gold. Certainly there are strange plans afoot.~
@368   = ~The bandits roaming the Coastway road are more organized than mere thieves. I'd almost say mercenary, but such talk will get me sacked.~

@379   = ~I hear that to prove you have actually taken his head, you have to produce Bassilus's holy symbol. Not that I would ever touch it of my own free will. He's one of Cyric's boys. They are just not right in the head.~

@448   = ~That's good. I've been having a lot of problems with bandit activity lately, but they've always only taken the cargo and let the caravan go afterward. I've been catching flak from the family of some of the passengers of this caravan, after all it was the job of my mercenaries to make sure everyone got safely to Baldur's Gate.

@456   = ~Well, look what I found. This is the body of Silvershield's son. Guess I'm in a lot of trouble now. With him dead, I'll be a wanted dwarf.

You can't blame her for not showing up, what with a villain like Feldepost running the place. She needs mercenaries to protect her until she's ready to go to Baldur's Gate.

@571   = ~So, Garrick, these are the only mercenaries you could find? I guess they'll have to do. I'm sorry, but my less-than-brilliant helper, Garrick, seems to have forgotten his standards. He offered you 300 gold, did he not? Well, I must change that to 200 gold.~
@572   = ~I'll raise your wage to 400 gold.~
@573   = ~Well then, I assume that Garrick has explained what your duties are. You must simply dispose of the ruffians when they come to threaten me. They shouldn't be too hard to deal with, but I would advise you to strike fast. Whatever you do, don't speak with them. One of them is a mage whose mystic words can sway even the wisest of men.~

@588   = ~Well, good sirs, you may call me Safana. You'll have to excuse me if I sound startled, but in the south where I come from they don't grow their men as big as any of you. Anyhow, if you want, I have a way to make you all fabulously wealthy. In my possession I have a map that gives the location of an old pirate treasure trove. According to the writings on the map, it's where the legendary Black Alaric dumped his treasure before being captured by the Amnian fleets! You interested in hearing more?~
@589   = ~My name is Safana and I can make all of you richer than any of you could imagine. I know where the pirate Black Alaric dumped his greatest trove of treasure. Looking at the dynamic and intelligent men before me, I know you'd want to join me in a venture to get this treasure.~
@590   = ~You may call me Safana if it pleases you. I guess you could say I'm an archeologist, at least I fancy myself one. Along the coast is the burial place of one of my ancestors. I wish to find it in order to learn some of the secrets of my family's past. Recently, I have come across a map that may reveal its location.~
@591   = ~The reason I need so many heroic men is that the caverns where I wish to go are guarded by some sort of creature. Which kind, I couldn't tell you. If you help me, I'll let you share in the treasure. I may be grateful in other ways as well.~
@592   = ~Ohh, thank you, you won't regret your decision. I know that powerful heroes like you will easily push through any obstacles in our path. Well, we should be off then. From what my map showed, the pirate cove is located somewhere along the coast, just south of Candlekeep.~
@593   = ~I guess I was wrong in my initial assessment, you're not men, but rather spineless, impotent cowards.~

@614   = ~(Is this what I have to work with? Pathetic, but it will have to do.) I am Edwin, and I would have you work for me. It is but the simple chore of killing the witch Dynaheir. Do you accept the task?~
@615   = ~(Hmmm, not the best specimens, but perhaps a more "bestial touch" is what my plan requires.) I would hire you to kill a treacherous enemy. Understand? She Dynaheir. She bad. You kill. Stomp your foot once for yes, twice for no.~

@620   = ~No? No matter, others will do just as well... Are you still here? Begone.~
@621   = ~Of course you will, it is as expected. (I will lead them to her and she cannot hope to prevail.) I will travel with you until the deed be done. I last heard of her traveling to the west of Nashkel, close to the gnoll stronghold located there.~

@623   = ~Greetings! I am Edwin and I wish to... Oh my. (She has allies already!) It would seem that the quarry I would have hired you to find is already within your midst! Dynaheir is not to be trusted, and I urge you to cast her from your party. If you will not, at least allow me to join you as well. I am a wizard of some renown, and as such I will not fall prey to the deceitful guile of one such as she.~
@624   = ~My grievance with her is beyond you. Suffice to say that she must be watched by someone who... understands her ilk.~

@626   = ~You shall be the harbinger of your own destruction. (Fools, they know not the danger.)~

Her demise is not the checkmate I had hoped for, merely the check. What? What do you want?! (Oh yes, the matter of payment, although I begin to doubt whether their input was all that vital. Still, something for their trouble is in order, if only to appease them.) As we never fixed a price, your payment shall be one year of my services as a wizard. I am sure you agree that my guidance will be far more valuable than any monetary sum.~
@629   = ~Damn it, Jebadoh, we can't go on like this forever! There is no way we can keep quotas up when we're afraid to come near the nets... Excuse me, who are you?~
@630   = ~Why do you stay the killing blow?! Kill her!~
@631   = ~Listen not to the witch's lies! We had a deal!~
@632   = ~(If they'll not do the deed then our deal is forfeit!) You side with the witch, then you will die with her! Beware my return!~
@633   = ~Nothing changes with the distance! You are Wychlaran of Rashemen, I am a wizard of Thay! That you are here means I must be as well!~
@634   = ~(I'll not suffer her insults!) Die as you should!~
@635   = ~(Their desires lack vision and originality.) If simple coin be all you wish, perhaps I would rather travel with more "adventurous" adventurers. Take what I have, and remember your choice when it is long since spent.~
@636   = ~Glorious Cyric has foretold of our meeting when thou wouldst join with me. 'Tis thy duty—nay, DESTINY—to stand by Tiax as the world kneels before him! Er... us. To this end, I would travel with thee and do thy bidding. Later, however, your power shall add to mine, and Great Tiax will ascend to the highest office in the land. What say you? Yea or nay to the grand scheme?~
@637   = ~Thou wouldst presume to speak to Tiax the Great? Thy bravery is oddly tempered with foolishness. Still, Cyric has decreed that I seek out the services of one such as thyself. Tiax himself—myself—will aid in your quest. In return, when the time is right, your might will forge the way for my ascension to power. Do you accept this honor?~
@638   = ~Have ye no ears to hear?! It is as Tiax said! DESTINY! Cyric himself will lift Tiax "on high," hurtling me to my rightful place when the time comes! You shall all be as ants before my grace, though slightly larger ants than the norm if you help me.~
@639   = ~Tiax the Grand has no time for your impudent prittle-prattle.~
@640   = ~What? Fate decrees the world to thine hands and you flout her as a common wench? Are ye cup shot? Mutton-headed fool, you and your natty lads will be fallen away from a horse load to a cart load whilst Tiax puts the world to bed with a shovel! 'Twill be a squeak for your life then, ye duke of limbs. Stir yer stumps and begone!~
@641   = ~'Twas fated by Cyric to be so. Let us go forth and make short work of your tasks, for greater things will need attendance.~
@642   = ~I thank thee for saving me. 'Twas courageous to follow the likes of Minsc into battle, if a touch foolish. I have naught to offer thee in return, save my services in battle. Mayhaps I could travel with thee awhile, and an opportunity may arise for repayment of my debt. Minsc is... well... Minsc, but he hath a strong sword arm, whilst I am practiced in the arcane arts. Shall we join?~
@643   = ~Thine efforts to save me are well appreciated, but I cannot help but be saddened. My guardian Minsc has left this life behind. His valor and mighty berserker wrath will not go unremembered. However, as I have lost my escort and 'tis not safe to wander these lands alone, perhaps I could join with thee. My knowledge of the arcane arts would no doubt be useful, while the strength of a group would benefit me as well.~
@644   = ~I am Dynaheir of Rashemen. 'Tis not a title; 'tis just where I am from. We two are indeed far afield of our home, but 'tis a necessary rite of passage. Minsc must make his dajemma by seeking adventure, while I must prove my worth to my... sisters in much the same manner. 'Tis an interesting time for the Realms, with great things foretold for the Sword Coast. 'Tis therefore a likely place to look for what we need. What dost thou seek on this adventurous road? Mayhaps we can all find what we need together?~
@645   = ~Alas, we were ambushed in the night. Minsc was overcome by yet another blow to the head, and I was spirited away before he could recover. With but two eyes apiece there is naught more we could have done. Certainly 'twill be safer for all of us if we join together. What sayest thou?~
@646   = ~The choice thou makest doth puzzle me, but 'tis thine to make. So be it.~
@647   = ~As thou dost wish, though the logic of thy decision escapeth me. Come, Minsc, we depart forthwith.~
@648   = ~I have no doubt thou shalt make an... interesting traveling companion.~
@649   = ~Thine assistance is most appreciated. 'Twas a dastardly fate thou hast saved me from.~
@650   = ~I see bravery was not all that motivates thee. I take it I am rescued from one death to die by another then? How can the cause be just? I urge caution; the likes of him are best kept at polearm's length.~
@651   = ~Put aside his paranoid goals; I make a far better friend than enemy.~
@652   = ~An unfortunate decision! Pardon me while I put up a fight!~
@653   = ~I knew intelligence would prevail. Simple common sense, the foil of every Red Wizard.~
@654   = ~I shall watch thee as well, though I expect to receive less pleasure from my task than thou from thine.~
@655   = ~They know enough to turn thee away. Crawl back to Thay and refine thy manners.~
@656   = ~We are nearly a season's travel from our northern homes, and yet still ye wish to dredge up the old battles? Fanatical fool!~
@657   = ~Thou knowest not even why I have traveled, only that thou must stop whate'er it is I've come to do?! Get thee a hobby; thou dost have too much time on thy hands!~
@658   = ~No, say not another word. I would not think of making you wait but a moment for your just reward. When council told me that they had procured GREYWOLF to rid the woods of the bandit Tonquin, I knew we could expect swift justice. I would not have predicted success this quickly, but who else could it be striding into town looking... ah... looking as you do? Please accept this meager sum of 200 gp, as well as the heartfelt thanks of all of Nashkel.~
@659   = ~You are not Greywolf the bounty hunter? Oh sweet Helm, I almost gave 200 gp to a complete stranger?! The captain best not hear of this; he'd have my hide. Thanks be for your honesty, stranger. There are those who would not have done as such.~
@660   = ~Excellent doing business with you, Greywolf. We shall not hesitate to call upon you if any other thieving miscreants make their presence known.~
@661   = ~Well! The elusive Brage is caught at last! I don't imagine it will take long to sort out your punishment, eh, murderer?! And you who've brought him, you've done us a great service and earned your 1,000 gold. We may retain your assistance in the future, though I don't think Greywolf would like it. Still, results are what matter. Come on, Brage, you know the way.~
@662   = ~A 300 gold bounty for the emeralds! Well, you'll make quite a name for yourself among the bounty hunters if you keep this up. Whether it is for better or worse, I do not know.~
@663   = ~You'll have no reward here, you thievin' scoundrel! The Captain chewed my head off over you! It's only because you did us this service that I don't have you thrown in the stocks! Get out of my sight!~
@664   = ~I have neither time nor will to deal with you today.~
@665   = ~Nashkel has precious little patience for those who would cheat others of their hard-earned livelihood.~
@666   = ~Ahhh, the elusive Brage. Dead, as he should be! No matter, it would have been a short trial, and he'd have been executed anyway. Now as a last indignity he'll be put in an unmarked grave like some common thief. A great loss to the guard to be sure, but there's no room for those who don't respect the law. You've earned your 250 gold on this one.~
@667   = ~I don't take kindly to those who snag another man's wage. I've a whack of my own to split between ye! 200 gold has bought ye a box of the finest pine! It's my trade to deal with the likes of you, but this I do for free!~
@668   = ~I have come for you, Prism.~
@669   = ~Your sentiment is wasted on me, fool. You are but gold in my purse. Do you make your situation worse by hiring help to protect you? Who are you fools?~
@670   = ~Wait! I recognize you! It was you that stole a bounty rightfully mine! Prism will live a moment longer while I kill the lot of you!~
@671   = ~You are smart to move aside, though Prism will be going nowhere this day. My bounty is not for his capture, but the return of the gems. His fate is unimportant, so any justice done will come by the blade of my sword. Stand ye well back, this may be messy!~
@672   = ~You should be more worried 'bout the harm I can do! Never have I taken a bounty and not delivered! Now stand aside that I might dispense with this fool and claim my prize. Or would you rather I go through you to get him? Consider well if he be worth your lives!~
@673   = ~I'll sell your blades for scrap and make soup of your spell fixings! Pity you'll not live to realize the mistake you've made!~
@674   = ~Ahh, beauteous creature! Never should I have stolen these emeralds, but there was nothing else that would capture the majesty of thine eyes! I did what must be done, for I have left my shop, forgotten all my commissions, and spent all that I had. I must complete thee! Wait, there is someone here! Who are you? 'Twas that relentless Greywolf who sent you, wasn't it?~
@675   = ~Thank Deneir, I thought I was done in. I am not cut out for a life on the run. Mayhaps you could help a foolish sculptor finish this epiphany? Please, guard this place, for surely Greywolf will come seeking the bounty on the gems. I will pay with my last possessions if you would do this one service for me.~
@676   = ~You'll not take me yet, I beseech thee! I admit I stole the gems, but better they are the eyes of a work of love than a fat woman's tawdry trinket. I will give you all else that is mine, if you would but forget my crime.~
@677   = ~I am no warrior, but I have little other choice. If you wish to stop my work, then it is my life that you must cease! I care not if I cannot finish my work! With my last breath I shall curse thee! May your soul know the same unrest as mine!~
@678   = ~I thank you, for I cannot run from this place until my task is done. I have been using potions of speed to aid my work, and have not slept for days. She is beautiful, is she not? 'Tis a monument to my foolishness. I saw her but once, on the outskirts of Evereska, and said nothing. I let thee pass from mine eyes, and mine heart hath cursed me for it!~
@679   = ~Then begone, for I've much work to do. She will be done this day!~
@680   = ~No! Not yet! My work is nearly done! Please, I implore you!~
@681   = ~Alas, my work is complete. Take what you will from my possessions, but leave the sparkle in her eyes. O sweet creature, my effigy to thee is done. Perhaps our paths shall cross in distant Realms, and I shall find the courage to call thy name. Ellesime!~
@682   = ~Alas, I shall not rest, for 'twas all for naught. Ellesime!~
@683   = ~Stop! You go nowhere! This our bridge. You pay to walk it!~ [GNARL01]
@684   = ~100 gold for all heads, or lose heads! Pretty good deal!~
@685   = ~No! They pay 200 gold pretty quick! Maybe got more gold! Maybe rich!~
@686   = ~You got smart head, so you keep head!~
@687   = ~Your head so dumb you not miss it!~
@688   = ~Yeah, you pay... 200 for all heads, or lose heads!~
@689   = ~Okay, maybe 200 gold too much. Maybe you pay... 100 gold!~
@690   = ~Okay, you pass, right?~
@691   = ~Now go away, smart head, before we charge for standing!~
@692   = ~Yeah! We kill you, take stuff, and get gold anyway! Dumb head!~
@693   = ~Yeah, you smart! We take heads anyway, and get lots gold!~
@694   = ~Please, kind spirits, a wondrous ancient oak is in peril. It is about to be attacked by two who would defile the majesty of nature. They have avoided my charms and must be stopped before irreparable harm is done. Would you heed my plea?~
@695   = ~I have little need or use for treasure you would value. Please! There is little time! Help me?~
@696   = ~But I possess nothing but my knowledge of the wood! Wait... I could give you information! I have heard from the birds of a "shiny pile" not far from here! I do not know what is there because neither I nor the birds have ever cared to know. Will this be enough?~
@697   = ~I thank you, for although they seem dim of wit, they still could do much damage. This way.~
@698   = ~Greetings. I am Seniyad. I warn you now, these are my protected lands. If you disturb the balance, the repercussions will be severe. Consider yourself warned.~
@699   = ~I shall find aid elsewhere. Do not tarry in my wood, for it will not be a restful stay.~
@700   = ~Leave at once, foul creatures! Lay not a finger upon this place or suffer the consequences!~
@701   = ~Thanks be to you! Here is a potion that might help you on your journeys.~
@702   = ~I thank you, though grudgingly. Perhaps I have something to give you, though it is not much. Please, leave me to fix what damage was done.~
@703   = ~You have done as you said you would, and here is the price you have exacted: directions to the cache and a cold farewell. Do not stay long in my wood. You are not welcome. You will find the treasure cache in the wolf cave just a hundred feet south of my tree.~
@704   = ~We think dis here's a magic tree, 'cuz it's all alone up here and so big. Probably got gnomes or pixies or sumthin' in it, so we're gonna bust it down and take any treasure! Ain't that right, Krumm? You wanna help? It's a big tree, probably got enough gold fer alluh us!~
@705   = ~I don't know who you are, but I'll not have you sneakin' about behind us while we work! We think there's treasure in this tree, and if you wanna get up front and help, do it! Otherwise, me n' Krumm will do sumthin... uh... well, sumthin' really nasty! Ain't that right, Krumm?~
@706   = ~First or last, we probable go through you sometime! Get them Krumm!~
@707   = ~Leave now or I bust yer head! Dis our magic tree, an any treasure here is ours! Right Krumm?~
@708   = ~Fine! You wanna busted head, then you get one!~
@709   = ~...Well, if ye're not gonna help, I'm not gonna let you sit and watch us do it! Yous were probably gonna rob us when we're done, weren't cha? Me an' Krumm don't cotton to bandits one bit! Do we, Krumm?~
@710   = ~Yeah! Beyond da average dreams for sure! We'll all go home richer today! You go 'round the back, an' me n' Krumm will start bashin' the front.~
@711   = ~Treasure for all? No, just treasure for Caldo and Krumm!~
@712   = ~Uh... Yeah!~
@713   = ~What?~
@714   = ~Uhhhhmmmm...~
@715   = ~Huh?~
@716   = ~An explorer of the lands seeking wonders and oddities. Well, both I have. Unfortunately, I paid thrice the price for my iron wares, and not a piece is salable! Mayhaps the guard will take more notice when old swords wear and the new snap like twigs in autumn. Nevertheless, you came here to buy, and I do have something special just for you. These potions are strange magic from a distant shore. A swallow of the violet, and a titan's might shall possess you; ever after, exceptional strength is yours. Drink down the red mix, and your insights will rival Elminster's, your clarity of thought indefinitely enhanced. To you, I offer them at the bargain price of 50 gold apiece, as restitution for my depleted selection. If they do not perform as I have promised, your money I will courteously refund. Will you relieve my hands of the violet?~
@717   = ~No? Such a grand gift as this and you would refuse? Please confirm that I have not offended you by at least accepting the red elixir. Steal it from under my own eyes for 40 gold.~
@718   = ~Already you must feel stronger just holding it in your hand. Yes, your packs weigh lightly upon your shoulders. Will you convince me of your satisfaction by purchasing the red elixir?~
@719   = ~Your eyes grow wide with the light of knowledge. Go forth now and I will enjoy the satisfaction of future great deeds done with my assistance. Ample compensation for practically giving merchandise away. Out, everyone out! You have picked me clean! I can afford no more good deeds this day!~
@720   = ~No? Please say I have not offended you in some manner! Ahh well, at least I will have the satisfaction of knowing that the glorious deeds you will surely accomplish are in some measure due to the goodwill I have shown today. Out, all of you, out! My coffers can ill afford any more charity! Thank you, everyone, for your patronage. Now out!~
@721   = ~You insult me by refusing my hospitality. I have done with you. Leave, and darken my humble tent no longer with your sour presence.~
@722   = ~I permit no loitering in my place of business. Get yourself hence, lest I summon the local guard as an escort.~
@723   = ~I am Death come for thee. Surrender, and thy passage shall be... quicker.~ [NIMBL01]
@724   = ~Struggle if you must, dead one, I do not mind working for my money.~
@725   = ~You are weak of spirit and not worth the money I was paid. I shall enjoy thee for a long, LONG time.~
@726   = ~Why NIMBUL has been hired to deal with the likes of you, I'll never know.~
@727   = ~By all means, fight on. 'Tis amusing, for thou art already dead.~
@728   = ~You cannot move, you cannot fight, you cannot even scream. NOW we will have SUCH fun!~
@729   = ~Hush little baby, don't say a word. Nimbul's gonna show you the big... black... bird.~
@730   = ~Taking reward for this easy a kill is almost a crime. Hee hee.~
@731   = ~I pray you left a trail of crumbs to lead us all back again. The others did not, so they have decided to stay. Shall we try to find the way home together? I pose to you a riddle, the answer to which I once knew but now cannot perceive. Remind me, and we shall all return unto the day. Fail, and stay with me in the dark, forgetting whence we came...

It has neither mouth nor teeth, yet it eats its food steadily. It has neither village nor home, neither hands nor feet, yet it wanders everywhere. It has neither country nor means nor office nor pen, yet it is ready for fight—always. By day and by night, there is wailing about it. It has no breath, yet to all it appears.~
@732   = ~Thine eyes are as blind as mine! If thou art in the darkness with me, then we are of the same cloth! I'll not allow another to do as I have! Die, monsters, DIE!~
@733   = ~The end of night, where the light shines unto mine eyes and I can see clearly once again! What hath I wrought?! 'Tis horrible, HORRIBLE! I will welcome the block that must await me at Nashkel! How could I live with what I've done?! Please, thou must guide me to the town that I might pay for my crimes! I fear I can keep my senses for only so long, and I must not be allowed to do this again! Too many good people have lost their lives to me! Please...~
@734   = ~I suppose I am a murderer, as you hast said, though it's as though my mind were elsewhere. I can only assume this is an after-effect of my years wielding a blade. A life of fighting must have made me... unstable. Well, I'm done with it! Take all my gear and do with it what you will. I'll not be needing it in the gallows. Lead on.~
@735   = ~I fear I can do nothing for those I've wronged, whether I live or die, and I still know not what led me to this. It's like a foul presence in my mind! I can only imagine that I have finally succumbed to battle fatigue. Take my weapon that I might not harm another! Use it if thou wish, though I'd rather it be destroyed. Innocent blood on everything! I'd only just acquired the sword. Such a waste this has been. Take me to Nashkel, I can bear this no longer.~
@736   = ~Money-hungry bounty hunters! A hundred more I could have killed, and you would have done nothing if there were no price on my carcass! I've no wish to continue this life, but I'll not lay down for thy easy money! You fooled me, but in reality your eyes are as blind as I was! Die monsters!~
@737   = ~No, I cannot show my face here after what I've done! Just give me to the guard that I might take my punishment as I should! Do not disgrace me further in front of Helm!~
@738   = ~But my crimes... my family... I don't want to go on!~
@739   = ~Greetings, fellow traveler, for I see by your garb that you do not call this place home. Sit with me awhile and enjoy the atmosphere of this fine fair while we recount tales of lands far and far-seeming. I have wandered the width and breadth of Faerun, but yet have I to find such hospitality as that of a simple country festival. It's a shame that the festivities are marred by the events as of recent, though they certainly put up a brave face, do they not? You look confused, so perhaps you know not of the local trouble that continues to vex the most gracious people of Nashkel. If you have just arrived, I could, for the price of an ale and an ear, relate what I know. Shall I tell you of their mining difficulties, or relate the tale of their unfortunate commander of the guard?~
@740   = ~Well, hello again, my inquisitive friend, I trust you are enjoying the local color. I wonder, have you come to hear more about my journeys?~
@741   = ~The word is that all across the expansive Sword Coast, from the Cloud Peaks to Baldur's Gate, an ore shortage is severely crippling local trade. Bandits—purportedly both human AND demihuman—raid caravans, whilst ore reaching its destination becomes brittle and useless following smelting, strangely afflicted by an odd, iron-weakening plague. As though this were not cause for alarm in itself, production at the mines outside of Nashkel has fallen, with the substantially lower yields being blamed on nervous workers. Mysterious disappearances of several miners have set the whole area on edge, where something must shift the balance to one side, or the other.~
@742   = ~I hear that Commander Brage of the Amnian guard has been missing for some weeks now following a strange alteration in his behavior. Where once he was a well-thought-of family man, he has turned to senseless mayhem, effecting a rampage the likes of which I have never heard. His fellow soldiers noted nothing out of sorts that could trigger such a transformation, but one notable item seems relevant. If not for the iron shortage it would have gone unnoticed but, prior to his mad rage, the commander procured a new sword. The importance of this information, I have no way of verifying.~
@743   = ~Just let me finish my drink, and then we can carry on through the wee hours with our tales.~
@744   = ~I'm afraid that, although I have enjoyed our chat immensely, and it has heartened me to see the wandering spirit is still venerated, I must take my leave. I need some time to myself for reflection upon everything I have learned while here in Nashkel.~
@745   = ~There is no cause to be rude. It would be good for you to leave.~
@746   = ~If you will, <SIRMAAM>, the tab? Mr. Volo was here for some time.~
@747   = ~Stiff a hardworking girl out of her meager wage, will you? Don't look favorably upon that, they don't, and I'm well liked 'round here. Maybe you trip and "fall" a few times when you meet a stranger in an alley. What say you rethink your position?~
@748   = ~Thank you kindly.~
@749   = ~Have it how you will, though you have been warned.~
@750   = ~Ahh, intrepid adventurers at our door. Helm guards over all the Realms and his servants are at your disposal. The Vigilant One stands ready to mend thy ailments and so divert the unyielding gaze of the Great Guide... for a suitable donation, of course. Just to demonstrate our mutual goodwill, you understand.~
@751   = ~You there, you have the look of hearty adventuring stock. I am Berrun Ghastkill, mayor of Nashkel. Might I offer you a proposition? I was expecting some people to help with our troubles, but they seem to have forgotten us. If you are up to it, I would ask that you take a look at the mines southeast of town. The miners claim there are demons or some such roaming about, but they are a superstitious lot and prone to exaggeration. I am more concerned with the state of our ore. All iron removed from the mines is tainted somehow, and useless for smithing. I would have you find out how it happens and who is behind it. You will be rewarded handsomely for your efforts.~
@752   = ~You there! What are ye doing in dis place? You better git outta here, 'less of course you know the password.~
@753   = ~Helm watch over you and our poor lost brother, Brage. A finer captain of the guard could nary be found this side of Amn. Such a strange change for one so devout as he. One does not usually change so drastically without nefarious help. If there be an evil influence on him, perhaps the harsh justice of the military should be stayed. He'll find no quarter at the garrison, but if he came to the temple... well... his restitution need not be his life. Is there anything I can help you with?~
@754   = ~Poor Brage. It's a pity he could not have been recovered alive. He might yet have come to terms with his actions and repaid the debt he incurred. Now all we can do is say the proper prayers and make sure the way to the next world is well guided. May Helm have pity on his tortured soul. Thank you for bringing his body here. No doubt Oublek would have made much of his death and further despoiled his name. I shall match the bounty you would have received so that you have not risked so much for nothing. The temple is in your debt.~
@755   = ~Calm yourself, Brage. Helm sees all that he wishes and knows much of what you do not. It was your hands indeed that did many a foul deed, but it was not your will alone. Intent is vital, and yours was influenced without your knowledge. Justice will be done, but with atonement, not punishment.~
@756   = ~Password? Why would I need a password? What in the Nine Hells are you talking about?~
@757   = ~If you are returned to the garrison, yours will be the only willful killing that has occurred about this matter. It would be a waste of your life which, fractured though it is, can still contribute much. Helm will see you through. As for our intrepid friends here, I shall exceed the reward offered by Oublek. After all, it was the same task of bringing Brage to justice. The temple is in your debt for the return of its lost son.~
@758   = ~Ya, I know the password.~
@759   = ~You there, you don't belong here! Go see the foreman or I'll call the guard!~
@760   = ~If ye no get the OK to be here, dem guards come and cut yer head from yer neck!~
@761   = ~Leave us be, there is much work to be done.~
@762   = ~Alvanhendar~
@763   = ~You there, you should not be here! You should see the foreman, Emerson.~
@764   = ~I wish you guys luck in there. Whatever's been causing all the trouble isn't something I'd wanna run into.~
@765   = ~~
@766   = ~Well, I see no harm. Indeed, we could be using the help. There be problems in the lower level, where we lost some workers. The men talk of things a-movin' below, but who's to say? The earth, she hides many things from sight.~
@767   = ~I really don't be needing adventuring fools wandering about me mines! Especially ones that think they can tromp about with nary a thought about askin' permission! Hmph! You've got one day. If I see you after that, I'll have a new shaft dug fer each of ya! Got that?! Good!~
@768   = ~Damn it, Jebadoh, we can't go on like this forever! There is no way we can keep quotas up when we're afraid to come near the nets. Excuse me, who are you?~
@769   = ~Cattack~
@770   = ~Tazok must have dispatched you, and my traitorous kobolds let you pass, didn't they? I knew I could not trust them! Armed as such, you have obviously been sent to kill me! By Cyric, not a measure of ore leaves these mines unspoiled, and I am still to be executed?! I'll not lose my head over this!~
@771   = ~Tazok is unfair. I have no desire to cheat him, or thee! My letters will show, they are in that chest. Take them, take them and Tazok will see!~
@772   = ~Tazok did not send thee? Then thou art dead! Help, my minions, HEEELLLPPP!~
@773   = ~I yield, I yield to thee! Accept my surrender?~

I have heard that he has come to this region, and I hope to meet him one day, to rectify my previous mistake. Your group seem to be adventurers... Perhaps you might come to fight my brother.

@834   = ~Our smith Taerom's been hit pretty hard by the iron shortage. His prices have only gone up because of it. Normally he is so reasonable, and better work you won't find anywhere. If ya need any weapons or armor, he's the man to see.~

@838   = ~Have you heard about the trouble down in Nashkel? The mines are supposedly tainted, and all the ore coming out is useless. I think Amn is just holding it back, trying to weaken our guards and troops. They've got another thing coming, they do.~
@839   = ~You look a lot like the bandits that raided my caravan! No, maybe it wasn't you. This crisis just has me on edge. I see bandits wherever I look. Hope it all ends soon, one way or another.~
@840   = ~Nashkel is a rotten town, run by a bunch of priggers. Betcha this iron shortage is just another Amnian plot. They would love to get a hold of Baldur's Gate, I just know it.~

@842   = ~My damn shovel broke today, then my hoe, and then, to top it all off, my scythe. They're all new tools too, bought from that flam, Taerom. He's getting a piece of my mind.~
@843   = ~I hear the Zhentarim have been spotted about lately. I bet ya them riff raff are up to no good. Can't trust a single one of them, you can't. They'll step over their own mother just for the sake of doing it!~
@844   = ~All the iron that comes from Nashkel has been tainted. It's those Amnians, up to their bottle-headed tricks I bet. We should just march over that little mine of theirs. I bet they are just faking all the trouble so as to weaken our guards and soldiers. Well, we will be ready when they come.~
@845   = ~I bet those rank-ridin' bandits are hired by the Amnians. It'd be like those moneygrubbers to pull something so low. Got to the point where an honest man can't travel the roads.~
@846   = ~My son was on one of the caravans that didn't make it to Baldur's Gate. I pray to Tymora that he's all right. May the Lady guide him safely home, and may she make the bandits trip on their swords. It's more humane than they deserve.~
@847   = ~I cannot talk now; my children are waiting for me at home. Not good to leave them alone for long, but both the husband and me must look for a way to keep gold coming in. Hard to keep food on the table when there is no work to be had.~

@849   = ~Shush, Angela, you know Momma doesn't want us to speak to strangers.~
@850   = ~You're the adventurers who killed all them monsters at Nashkel, aren't you? You must be really brave. If we had more like you we'd never have to worry about things like this again.~
@851   = ~You're those mercenaries that the whole town's been talking about. Well, get out of my way. We don't need the likes of you causing trouble. Don't you go and aggravate those bandits. It just makes them all the more vicious.~
@852   = ~Filthy mercenaries. They won't get away with their raiding. Duke Eltan will send the Flaming Fist, and that'll be that. Nobody with any sense wants to risk fighting with the Flaming Fist. They mean business, they do. You get an enforcer on you, and best you run like the dickens.~
@853   = ~Travelers, huh? You're the first group to come into town all day. Not many have braved the roads since all the trouble started up. We've seen only ten new faces in the last month. Found a lot of bodies, unfortunately.~

@855   = ~All those new tools I bought turned brittle as clay. I'm starting to believe the tales about this faulty iron that's been being sold. We're going to be in a sorry state when all our old tools and weapons wear out.~
@856   = ~I'm moving out soon, what with all the rumors about Amn going about. I hear they have an army down in Nashkel. Gonna use the Friendly Arm to launch against the Gate, I hear. Hopefully I'm gone by then.~
@857   = ~You don't go believing every little thing being bandied about. A lot of it is just people getting worried 'bout nothing. Those gossips in Beregost are always coming up with new rumors to tell travelers. Us here at the Friendly Arm, we should have more sense.~
@858   = ~Aren't you the one who came by a while back? I heard you've been cleanin' house down south. Good on you.~
@859   = ~I think it's those Zhentarim who've been causing all the problems 'round these parts. Amn don't have a real reason to invade, so it don't make any sense thinking they are behind it. Zhents don't need a reason though, and a lot of clues point to them too.~
@860   = ~I'm sorry, my husband doesn't like me to speak with strangers.~
@861   = ~Stay away, I bet you're those Zhentarim. I hear they turn women into goats at the snap of their fingers. I heard they were behind the trouble in Nashkel, and maybe other places too! Just you stay away from me!~
@862   = ~You aren't from Nashkel are you? I hope not, because we don't trade with them at all anymore. All the iron we get from the mines there is tainted. Weak as tissue it is.~
@863   = ~You're the adventurers from Nashkel I've heard all about. Wow, I've never seen real heroes before. I hope you busted some bandits over the head on your way here. That'll learn them something.~
@864   = ~I really don't feel like talking to you right now! I lost my husband to those bastard raiders. I hope they rot through all the Nine Hells!~
@865   = ~Not many come by the Inn since the raiding started up. It's good to see a new face about. I was getting pretty tired of the old ones. Maybe I'll chance the roads and try to get to Beregost one of these days.~
@866   = ~Damn it, Jebadoh, we can't go on like this forever! There is no way we can keep quotas up when we're afraid to come near the nets... Excuse me, who are you?~
@867   = ~It is a surprise to find such beautiful people wandering these woods. All of you look rather weary, down on your times I might say. Why don't we all rest and I'll treat you to some refreshments, perhaps some Berduskan amber wine?~
@868   = ~Sorry if I seem out of breath, but I had to retreat from a battle. I was ambushed by a dozen gnolls farther back on the trail. I handily dispatched them but thought better of fighting their half dozen ogre friends. I think I've evaded them for now. Would any of you care for a drink of some fine Selgauntian brandy?~
@869   = ~I must take my leave now.~
@870   = ~Well, you needn't be so rude, I apologize for offering my hospitality.~
@871   = ~All right, let's go about this again. Join me for a drink.~
@872   = ~I hope you are enjoying your liquor; it is some of the best you can find. All of you are probably wondering why I'm being so generous, "obviously not from the kindness of his heart," you think. Well, in a way, I am. You look like the type to be on the outlook for ways to improve the quality of your life. Well, I have a proposal that could help you in that endeavor. You see, there's a girl, my lover in fact, who desires to escape her father and live on her own. Her father is Entar Silvershield, one of the dukes of Baldur's Gate. This, of course, makes her desires more difficult than that of the average city girl. However, with your assistance, we could help her escape the tyrannical clutches of Entar. Here's the punchline: Since Entar's going to be hunting us anyway, we can blackmail him for hoards of cash and not worry about our captive escaping. After all, we're doing it all for the sake of Skie. Now, we needn't go about this right away. In fact, I'll help you with whatever you're doing until you decide to head up to Baldur's Gate. Just think of it as one favor deserving another.~
@873   = ~You're missing the opportunity of your life.~
@874   = ~I'm glad you're all savvy enough to recognize a good opportunity when it comes.~
@875   = ~Do you remember our agreement? You had agreed to help me kidnap Skie from the estate of Entar Silvershield. Well, I think this is the perfect opportunity. I could take us to the estate right now.~
@876   = ~You had agreed. If you're not going to live up to your part of the bargain, I'll find someone else who will.~
@877   = ~Just follow me.~
@878   = ~Aren't you coming?~
@879   = ~This is the estate right here. Skie has told me that there is a secret door in the northern section of the wall. I'll find it.~
@880   = ~We should sneak in and find her room. Once there, we'll sneak her out through this secret door. We shouldn't kill any guards, as that will bring the wrath of the Flaming Fist down on our heads.~
@881   = ~When the word "stupidity" was introduced to the language, they must have had you in mind. I'm not going to be a part of this group.~
@882   = ~Skie! It's good to see you again, we're here to get you away from this place. These people with me are friends of mine. We're what you might call adventurers.~
@883   = ~Let's get out of this place as soon as possible.~
@884   = ~If you won't have Skie, then there's no place for me with you either.~
@885   = ~I have to make a visit to the Blade and Stars tavern to pick up the ransom money for this week. I'll be right back.~
@886   = ~Yes, we're sort of thirsty right now.~
@887   = ~We don't have the time to drink with strangers.~
@888   = ~Sure, give us some booze.~
@889   = ~Likely story, and we defeated fifty tarrasques a day ago. Bugger off.~
@890   = ~Sure, we could use the extra help, and your scheme sounds like it could work.~
@891   = ~Are you always this slimy, or is this one of your better days? Go find someone else to help in your worthless schemes.~
@892   = ~Not now.~
@893   = ~Sure, lead the way.~
@894   = ~Good riddance.~
@895   = ~Hey, we're sorry. Take us to the estate.~
@896   = ~It's refreshing to find other people in this wood. My name is Coran, thief and archer! I've been alone in the wilderness for far too long. I wouldn't mind returning to the big city, but I have yet to collect my bounty. I'd share the reward with the lot of you if you would help hasten the hunt. You interested in hearing more?~
@897   = ~Sorry if I startled you, but I always approach strangers cautiously. I'm Coran, hunter and archer. Are any of you interested in making some money? If you are, I'm the person who could help you do it.~
@898   = ~Sorry to be so abrupt, but I haven't time for monotonous chitchat.~
@899   = ~No problem, though you are missing quite the little adventure.~
@900   = ~Good, I'm glad you're smart enough to recognize opportunity when it comes knocking. The deal is this: I've been hired out by the mayor of Beregost to hunt down a great winged dragon that's been plaguing the caravan routes. He's offered 2,000 gold for its head. Now before you get cold feet, let me allay your fears. The only descriptions of the beast have always mentioned its deadly barbed tail. From what I know about dragons they don't have barbs on their tails; that's something unique to wyverns. So all we have to do is find this wyvern's nest and kill it. Our only worries are if it has friends over for dinner! So what is your decision, yea or nay?~
@901   = ~Very well then. We shouldn't tarry any longer; let's collect the heads of those soon-to-be-sorry wyverns.~
@902   = ~Aren't stout enough of heart? I can understand, not all of us are.~
@903   = ~This is very unnerving, I know, but you must trust me. It is very important that you pack your possessions so that we may leave Candlekeep immediately. Hurry, for there is no time to tarry! The keep is well protected but not invulnerable.~
@904   = ~Perhaps you've changed your minds about my offer from before. Come now, it would be quite the adventure.~
@905   = ~Yes, tell us more.~
@906   = ~Nope, go away.~
@907   = ~Yes, tell us more.~
@908   = ~No time for that right now.~
@909   = ~Yea.~
@910   = ~Nay.~
@911   = ~Please! Don't kill me. I'll tell you where the mines are. Yes, I'll do that for you if you spare me! The entrance is in the bailey to the east. Please let me live.~
@912   = ~Is there a reason for you being here? You had better have a good explanation for bothering me!~
@913   = ~We're here on business. We wanted to purchase some of your iron.~
@914   = ~We don't really need a reason. We're here to kill you.~
@915   = ~If you set me free, <SIRMAAM>, I can tell you how to bring this mine crashing down around the heads of these fat-headed slavers.~
@916   = ~Well, see, here's how it is: The way to bamboozle these ninnies is real easy. Right here beside me is a steel plug that stoppers up the river on the surface. If you were to release that, then the whole mine would be drowned. Only the master of the mine has the key to open the plug, and he's a real mean cuss. If you were to bring the key to me, I could use it to flood the mine.~
@917   = ~Those aren't the Blacktalons.~
@918   = ~We'll set you free. Now tell us what you know.~
@919   = ~Shut up, you fool.~
@920   = ~You're a bunch of greenheads, ain't ya? You've come here to guzzle, or maybe one of you handsome stags wants to shag me. I am quite a fubsy, aren't I? Heh heh heh.~
@921   = ~Ya buncha chuckle headed shag bags, try to sneak by me, will ya? I'm going to drub you but good.~
@922   = ~I am Branwen, a war-priest from the Norheim Isles. I have been trapped in stone for what seems like an eternity. You have saved me, and for that I owe you my life. I am indebted to you, and by Tempus, I leave no debt unpaid! Let me join whichever cause you're fighting for, I should make a valuable ally and bring the favor of the Lord of Battles upon us.~
@923   = ~It's an insult to my honor to refuse my services, but the choice is yours.~
@924   = ~I am glad to be part of your war party. I will not make you regret your decision. A word of caution though: Beware of the dog that entrapped me in stone. Tranzig, he called himself. He was in the employ of a mercenary group, but I do not know the name. I shall see him dead before I see the shores of home again!~
@925   = ~We're always on the lookout for another warrior.~
@926   = ~~
@927   = ~I have no need of your services. Take your freedom and be off with you.~
@928   = ~Oh, a fine sight are you, whoever you are! Sick to death of bandits, I am! I have been cooped up the longest time, but if you've a spare mace, I'd gladly swing it for yer cause. I can do things cleric-wise as well, so I'm mind as well as muscle. By Clangeddin, a chance to right past wrongs! Can I join you?~
@929   = ~I don't know who you are, but I'm glad to see you nonetheless. I canna be done with this place soon enough! I don't fancy the look of you, but if you be against the Throne you've my best blessings. In fact, I'll do you better than blessings. This mine was once my clan-home, and after that my clan-tomb. We breached a riverbank over a hundred years ago and most of us died. A few survived, but we left the mine flooded as a monument to the dead. I got trade-work at the Iron Throne smithing, but I then told my "friend" Rieltar about my old home. They chained me up and tortured the location out of me, and now my home feeds the Iron Throne and their evil plans. I'd sooner destroy it again than have the Throne use it so! Here are directions to the lower levels. They plugged the hole to the river, but knowing hands can loose it again! Flood the blaggards out! I must leave, I can bear the sight of this place no longer. I'll black a few eyes on the way out though! Clangeddin's might be with you!~
@930   = ~That you have, and none would know better than I. This is my mine that the blasted Iron Throne has stolen. Well, it was my clan's home 125 years ago. Curse me for a fool, I trusted them! Years ago, that blasted Rieltar gave me a good trade smithing for the Throne, and then I go and tell him about my old home! About how my clan had the richest iron mine on any coast, and how almost all were killed when we breached a riverbank. Lost most my kin in that flood. Those of us that survived couldn't bear to go back down. It was a giant watery tomb, and we left it the way she stood. So I go and tell this to my "friend" Rieltar, and he has me chained up! He tortures the location outta me, and now this graveyard feeds the Iron Throne as they bleed the coast dry. If you want to cripple their plans, help me flood this accursed mine once more! They plugged the breach, but knowing hands can loose the flow! We can drown these black-hearted rats in the very mine they've stolen! Here be the way!~
@931   = ~You're a bit of a fool to refuse any help, though perhaps foolhardy risks are called for. So be it, I'll go my own way. I will tell you how to hurt these blaggards though. This mine here, it was my clan's long ago. We were just tapping the richest ore deposits when we breached a riverbank. Most of us died, and those that lived left the mine a flooded tomb. So here's the fool me, who gets a trade with the Iron Throne. My "friend" Rieltar learns of my past and tortures the mine location outta me! Now my clan graveyard feeds the Throne while they starve the coast of ore. Here be directions to the river breach. Knowing hands can loosen the magical plug and flood the mine again. Do this for me, and for yourselves if you be against the Throne. I'll make my way out without you, but I'll black a few eyes on the way.~
@932   = ~All help is welcome. We've much to overcome.~
@933   = ~I've no need of you. Take your freedom and go.~
@934   = ~Why have you come? Is it to steal my riches, or perhaps you seek to righteously punish me for my affront to your morality? It matters little, for you will do neither. Before I dispose of you in some horribly gruesome manner, perhaps I should introduce myself. I am known as Davaeorn. I would ask you for your names, but I care little to become acquainted with the dead.~
@935   = ~There are still more doppelgangers. We won't be safe until you've killed them all.~
@936   = ~You meddling fools! Your victory shall be short-lived.~ [DAVEO02]
@937   = ~I really think that Duke Eltan should bring in part of the Flaming Fist and put down these wild men of the woods.~
@938   = ~I can't believe they killed Elban. Those bastards! They are going to pay!~
@939   = ~Oh, I apologize for my rudeness. I mistook you for someone else. Let me introduce myself. I am Aldeth Sashenstar. You must understand that at the moment, I'm under a terrible amount of stress. You see, my dear <SIRMAAM>, there is a group of uncouth savages that has declared their intention of killing my friends and me. I've been holed up in this cabin for several days and have lacked the wherewithal to try and make an escape. Perhaps you kind <SIRMAAM> would help a fellow in trouble?~
@940   = ~What purpose have you wandering this far into Cloakwood? Are you looking to earn some money? If you are, I would be willing to pay a considerable amount for your assistance. I am Aldeth Sashenstar, a noble from the city of Baldur's Gate. Perhaps you have heard of me? No matter. I am looking for some good strong people who could defend me against a band of savages. These ruffians have been threatening my companions and me with bodily harm. Would you be interested?~
@941   = ~Whoever you are, get away from here. We do not need any more miscreants to cause trouble here.~
@942   = ~Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way. You're probably as insensitive as those hoodlums out in the wood. Learn some manners, brute.~ [ALDET04]
@943   = ~Good! I'm glad you had the sense of decency to help a man in my situation. Let me explain my predicament. My friends and I come here every year to do some sport hunting. This year however, a group of woodland savages threatened us with bodily harm if we did not stop our hunting trip. Being civilized men, we realized that it's well within our rights to hunt where we damn well please. After a few more days of hunting, the crass woodmen lost all pretense of humanity and murdered Elban, one of my oldest friends. I'm sure that they plan to attack our cottage here, so we had best be prepared.~
@944   = ~Do not listen to these slavering wild men, my dear <SIRMAAM>. They lie as befits the uncultured barbarians that they are.~
@945   = ~What?! Have you gone mad, throwing your lot in with a band of madmen? You treacherous savages, you will suffer for your foolishness! I will deal with Seniyad after I kill you!~
@946   = ~I give you my gratitude for the aid you have given us. If you ever travel to Baldur's Gate, come to the Merchants' League Estate, and I will aid you in any way I can. Take now this small token of my appreciation.~
@947   = ~Yes, we would.~
@948   = ~No, we don't have the time.~
@949   = ~Yes, we would.~
@950   = ~No, we don't have the time.~

With them we have no quarrel. It is now to you that I speak: These men have most likely duped you into protecting their sorry hides. They have most likely not told of the druid they have slain in cold blood. I will allow you to rethink your earlier decision and leave these men to their most deserved fate.~
@953   = ~You have made your choice, fools, now you will suffer together with your hunter friends.~
@954   = ~I congratulate your wise decision. I wish you well for whichever endeavor you now embark. If your presence in this wood involves those known as the Iron Throne, then I would suggest you head west, then north.

I don't know what their purpose is, but they have been running my business very poorly. All of you will be well rewarded for rescuing me. When you meet Scar again, he will give you my reward. I must be off now, as there is much of the monsters' work to be undone. I assume you've dealt with the other monsters upstairs. If you haven't, I'll get the Flaming Fist to clear out the rest.

@1033  = ~I thought you were a <MANWOMAN> of nobility. I must have been mistaken. Well, there is little I can do but try to find someone who is up to the task. I'll be here some while more, so if you deign to change your mind, speak to me again.~

@1035  = ~Back, I see.~
@1036  = ~Thank you so much, my friends. This should suffice for privacy. I'm sorry for all of this hiding and skulking, but there are dire events afoot. You know that I am one of the principal shareholders of the Merchants' League. Well, I share ownership of the company with two others: Irlentree and Zorl Miyar, two very distinguished gentlemen. When I returned from my hunting trip—thanks to you, I might add—I found that my two partners had undergone some profound changes, nothing physical or overt, but something far more sinister.~
@1037  = ~It's... as if my partners had become wholly different people while I was gone. They almost take an active interest in squandering our company's resources on frivolous and stupid ideas.

@1038  = ~Come into the Merchants' League Estate with me. I will explain that you are old friends of mine, and will quarter all of you in the guest chambers.

@1085  = ~Hold! I'm commander Brandilar, I lead the household guard. You must be the people Aldeth brought back with him, his so-called "childhood friends." That likely story might have hoodwinked some of the others, but I've known Aldeth since he was a kid, and none of you ring any bells.~
@1086  = ~You there! I don't care if you're the guests of Aldeth, you just make sure you don't cause any trouble while you're here. I'm commander Brandilar, leader of the household guard. If a problem arises, you better be sure I'll hear of it.~

They haven't been themselves, and they seem to have a completely callous outlook on the future of their business. I'd almost have to say that Irlentree and Zorl aren't who they say they are, or they've had their minds taken over, or some other rot. Unfortunately, there's nothing I can do because they're my employers. I might be able to turn a blind eye if you were to investigate what they've been doing. If you can find some hard proof that exposes what's been happening, I might be able to do something about this whole mess. What do you say?~

@1130  = ~Steady, Telman. What he means is, we're being harassed by a priest of the Bitch Queen Umberlee. We don't even know why, but whenever we attempt to fish she turns the weather sour. Two of us were washed away just walking to the docks, but we cannot prove to the guard it was her. We be needin' someone to strong-arm her into leaving us alone. We've not much money, but I'll gladly give you a... magical weapon from my grandfather's adventuring days. It's a meager amount for your trouble, but it would be a great service to us. Will you help a group of poor fishermen?~
@1131  = ~Ahh, I knew we could depend on you to do what's right. She hides out near a small shack to the north. Watch yer backs and act quickly; she's tricky. Good luck, brave friends.~
@1132  = ~Maybe you don't hear so good?! We're poor, remember?~
@1133  = ~Now Jeb, maybe they're leery of the danger because the group of us can do nothing against the Umberlee bitch. We are but fishermen and not accustomed to fighting, while you are obviously better equipped. No doubt you shall change your mind?~
@1134  = ~I guess you were right, Jeb; ain't no wind in their sails! Leave us be. We'll fix our own problems.~
@1135  = ~Have you changed your mind, or are you just drifting in and out with the tides?~
@1136  = ~Then I've not the time for you. Goodbye.~
@1137  = ~Hold your tongue, Telman. Now I warned ya she was treacherous. You've gone and believed her lies, haven't you?. What did she say, that we stole some bowl or something? Seems a pretty shallow excuse to kill us over, doesn't it? Now as I said before, we are but poor fishermen, but what if we toss in another... oh... 100 gold. Will that change your mind?~
@1138  = ~Well, the offer has been made. Is that enough now, or does this shakedown continue?~
@1139  = ~Your name won't mean much if you go around breakin' deals. So be it; we'll deal with the child ourselves.~
@1140  = ~Suffice to say, we made other arrangements for our safe passage at sea. Part of that deal was a little payback as well. So you see, we are all pawns within the "friendly" rivalries of the gods. You had best tread carefully, lest you step on some pretty powerful toes.~
@1141  = ~I suppose I have little choice then. I've had it on me the entire time; we felt it was safest that way.~
@1142  = ~Take it, but know that the Storm Lord knows who it is that opposes him.~
@1143  = ~You've got what ye came for, now get out of here. I should stay well away from any Talos shrine if I were you. Vengeful things, these gods.~
@1144  = ~We all will, friend. Hear that boys? The child is dead! We'll be back to our boats tomorrow with smooth sailing forever! The Bitch Queen can't touch us now, and we'll take her seas for all they're worth! And to you, my heroic saviors, to you go the spoils. Behold the mystical marvel that is my grandfather's flail. Enjoy.~

@1148  = ~As cowardly as they are treacherous, hiring others to do what they could not! Tonight I shall put an end to all of this! The seas cry for vengeance!~

Now they all misuse a gift from Umberlee to pillage the seas, and my mother's spirit can't rest until it is returned. I have more power than mother had. Umberlee gave me her anger, but I can't find the bowl. All I can do is hurt them till they give it back or die, but I'm so tired. I don't have mother's will, and the goddess is so demanding. Help me, please.~
@1153  = ~Then you had best kill me now. All who malign Umberlee must be punished, and she will not let me stop!~
@1154  = ~Oh, thank you! The Sea Queen may yet be satisfied with the return of the bowl, but one way or another Sonner's group must no longer profit at her expense. It is probably being hidden in a shrine to another god. I don't know where the shrine is and couldn't go near even if I did, but Sonner may tell you... if you ask him with a blade. Go now, for Umberlee is seldom patient, and you are not yet on her good side.~

@1156  = ~The Bitch Queen is not called so because of her patient nature. Quicken your step.~
@1157  = ~I have no further need of vengeance. Umberlee is mother now, and she is well pleased. The blood spilled today will remind all of her mastery of the waters. Hopefully Talos will tire of these little games. You have been a most useful tool, and the Sea Queen shall reward you... in time.~
@1158  = ~Umberlee is mother now, and she is well pleased. She will deal with Sonner's group in time, and Talos will no doubt abandon them for their failure. If they are wise they will never set sail again, for the sea will take their worthless lives. I have no reward for you, but the Sea Queen remembers those that serve her well. You will be paid... in time.~
@1159  = ~So be it! It's your own grave you dig, for Umberlee shall not be denied!~
@1160  = ~I shall deal with them myself then. It's no longer the time for subtlety!~

@1190  = ~It's a risk, I know, but we must think about keeping our numbers up! We'll not have the time to bring more from Iriaebor. Better that we recruit here. They've already proved themselves to me.~
@1191  = ~I know, Tazok. We just though that you might want to question them. They seem to know something about what is going on!~
@1192  = ~We need to keep our numbers up! Besides, we checked them out pretty good. I think they'll do fine.~
@1193  = ~Pick up the pace, else you die slow as well!~
@1194  = ~Drop ye weapons and mayhaps ye outlive the day! I'll no be sayin' it twice!~

@1196  = ~We'll not fight you. In fact, we want to join your group.~
@1197  = ~We don't want any trouble. Take what you want and leave us be.~
@1198  = ~At their throats, men, for today they wish to die!~
@1199  = ~There be a good group o' heroes. Now we be takin' any iron for the boss, and any gold for ourselves. Planning for the future I be.~
@1200  = ~Ha! We've plenty o' mules now! What for we be needin' you?~
@1201  = ~This is a bloodthirsty job you have, and we like the killin'! Let us join and the roads will run red 'neath our feet!~
@1202  = ~Tazok can ill afford to turn down any offer of help. It's a monumental task he has ahead.~
@1203  = ~But there's no future in anything else! Everyone is afraid of you, and I want to be respected like that too! Please? Pretty pleeeeeease?~
@1204  = ~You're too good at your job! We can see which way the wind is blowing, and whatever you're doing, we want in. It's the only real profit on the Sword Coast today.~
@1205  = ~You be dead before dawn, an' probably take us all wit' you! We've no room fer lunatics! Now do ye surrender or no?~
@1206  = ~Aha, the fury of youth! Just wind ya up and point ya in the right direction, eh? Well, we'll see if the boss wants any more berserkers. Let's move.~
@1207  = ~Aye, Tazok be my master's name, but how would ye know that? Blasted spies you are! Have at them, men!~
@1208  = ~We've no room for whiners! Surrender now and ye be home to mommy in time for din-din!~
@1209  = ~Shut yer sweet-mouth 'fore I gag, and choose to live or choose to die!~
@1210  = ~Save your sweet talk fer the boss. I'll take ya to meet him but if he says ya die, then ya die. No chance to surrender then.~
@1211  = ~What are you doing here?! We are about to enter the last remaining room, and I don't want the likes of you around when we make our discovery.~

@1221  = ~Damned if I be lettin' you go after this mess. Ye're gonna have a chat with Tazok back at the camp, you will, and explain why you've delayed us! Or maybe ya just die tryin'!~
@1222  = ~They's a bit more than just mouthy. They interested like they be knowin' something about what's going on! I just figured Tazok would want to know where they got their info. That would be bloody important, wouldn't it?~
@1223  = ~I eyed 'em well 'fore bringin' 'em this far, and they be as good as we got. We ain't got the time to do formal training to cover our losses. We'll be no use if we don't fill in the ranks.~

@1230  = ~Hey, everybody, let's all play a game called "what-have-ya-got-to-lose?" We're trying to infiltrate the bandits in the area, so we'd like you to PRETEND to be afraid of us, and give us most of your gold, weapons, and iron. Otherwise, those REAL bandits behind us will come over here, slaughter you all, and take EVERYTHING.~
@1231  = ~Well, which is it? If I drop my weapons like you said, I'm gonna be in motion. Likewise, if'n I stay still I can't rightly disarm. Straighten yerself out and come at that again. This time like ya mean it.~
@1232  = ~I don't think you've got the muscle to back up those threats, so why don't you just git along 'fore we put a hurtin' on you.~
@1233  = ~Everyone please stop where you are and don't move! Drop your weapons and gold, and this will all be over quick!~

@1243  = ~We only work for Aldeth.~
@1244  = ~No such luck just yet.~

@1265  = ~Before we go on, perhaps it would be well if I introduced myself. I am Deagan, employee of the Merchants' League. My master has need of services that only you would be able to provide. He is one of the owners of the Merchants' League Estate. If you were willing to speak with him in private, he would pay you 5 gold each, before you agreed to do anything for him. What do you say?~
@1266  = ~If you would be kind enough to follow me, I can show you to him right away. He wishes to meet with you at the Three Old Kegs.~
@1267  = ~I thought you had agreed to come. You haven't changed your minds, have you?~
@1268  = ~This is my master, Aldeth Sashenstar.~

@1273  = ~I say nay.~
@1274  = ~Free money, why not?~
@1275  = ~Hold your horses, we're coming!~
@1276  = ~Actually we have, bye.~
@1277  = ~Greetings, you are all new faces. I am Zorl, and you must be Aldeth's childhood friends?~
@1278  = ~Perhaps we will have another more convenient time to talk.~
@1279  = ~So, were you good friends with Dabron as well?~
@1280  = ~You don't remember Aldeth's brother? Most interesting.~
@1281  = ~I don't like these sniveling primates interfering with our work, Jased! Say the word.~
@1282  = ~You seem to have an unhealthy interest in wandering the halls of our consortium. Perhaps it would be best for you to return to your room.~
@1283  = ~Perhaps, Aldeth, your memory has become somewhat addled. You seem to be forgetting and even inventing elements of your past. Take, for example, your "childhood" friends. A most stupid lie, meat.~
@1284  = ~Before you die, primates, I have been instructed to give you a message from our employer, Rieltar. He wishes you to know how much fun it's been matching wits with you.~
@1285  = ~Are you going somewhere? We thought it was best for you to stay for the festivities. Why don't you turn back now and return to where you're wanted?~
@1286  = ~No, I'm the one who's sorry.~
@1287  = ~Is there a reason for this intrusion?~
@1288  = ~So you have learned the truth, primate. It will do you no good. Prepare to die.~
@1289  = ~Greetings, house guests. I must assume that you are the friends that have had Aldeth so excited. I must introduce myself: I am Irlentree, one of Aldeth's partners in business. I've come to announce that the company is celebrating the anniversary of Aldeth's stay with us. I would like you to join us for the festivities. There should be some interesting... surprises.~
@1290  = ~No, I don't think you understand. I insist that you be there. You should go soon... I'm sure you'd enjoy it.~
@1291  = ~The party is set to take place on the third floor. If you go up there... I'll meet you soon after.~
@1292  = ~Belt~
@1293  = ~Are you sure Aldeth, I was most certain that this was the day.~
@1294  = ~Come now Zorl, we mustn't be so rude. These primates are about to take the final step, to become something much greater than what they were.~
@1295  = ~Sorry, we don't feel up to it right now.~
@1296  = ~We'll be there.~
@1297  = ~Yeah, we've been friends since we were kids.~
@1298  = ~Sure, but we don't have time to chat. We've got a lot of catching up to do with Aldeth.~
@1299  = ~Dabron?~
@1300  = ~Oh, yeah, Dabron. Sure we were.~
@1301  = ~Actually, we kind of want to talk old times with our buddy here. We'll see you later.~
@1302  = ~Aldeth gave us free reign of the entire place.~
@1303  = ~Sure, we don't want any trouble.~
@1304  = ~You're right, we'll go back to the party.~
@1305  = ~We're sorry, but we can't do that.~
@1306  = ~Hold! You are the new mercenaries in town, are you not?~
@1307  = ~Do not presume to lie to me, scum. It was you who killed my brother Aldeth, and it is you who shall pay!~
@1308  = ~Then do you not admit to have killed a small group of hunters along the edge of Cloakwood?~
@1309  = ~I grow tired of your falsehoods.~
@1310  = ~One of the men you helped murder was a young man named Aldeth Sashenstar. Perhaps you remember the name?~
@1311  = ~You have spoken the harshest insult, not even remembering the name of the one you have murdered.~
@1312  = ~Perhaps I should introduce myself, I am Dabron Sashenstar, the brother of the man you most foully killed. Draw steel, scum! It is time for justice to be served.~
@1313  = ~That's too bad.~
@1314  = ~Yes, that would be us.~
@1315  = ~Got the wrong people, fella.~
@1316  = ~Yep, that was us.~
@1317  = ~Ahhh, no, we didn't do any such thing.~
@1318  = ~How can we remember the name of someone we've never met?~
@1319  = ~Sorry, doesn't bring back any memories.~
@1320  = ~Aldeth? Yeah, I remember running him through. He was kind of the screaming type.~
@1321  = ~We don't want to fight you.~
@1322  = ~If you want a fight, we're fully prepared to give you one.~
@1323  = ~I am Lothander, partner of the assassin Marek. I do not wish you harm.~
@1324  = ~My partner, Marek, has poisoned you. While you slept, he slipped a slow-acting magical poison into your rations. You have about ten days to live. Common priest spells won't help you. Only one thing can, and that's the antidote. I can help you find it, if you help me first.~
@1325  = ~Do you take me for an idiot? I don't have the antidote, I only know where it can be found.~
@1326  = ~Your mistake, and most probably your last.~
@1327  = ~My problem is this: I don't work for the Iron Throne because I wish to but rather because I have been forced. I have been enspelled with a geas. If I do not obey everything that Marek orders of me the spell will take effect and I shall waste away. I need a way to rid myself of the spell. I know of a diviner at the market square who may have the answers I seek, but I don't have the money to pay him. Will you help me?~
@1328  = ~You can kill me then; it does not matter. If I were to help you find the antidote, the geas would take effect, and I would die.~
@1329  = ~You must help me! Now that I have actively tried to have the geas removed, my life is forfeit. Please reconsider.~
@1330  = ~Step in here to the diviner's tent.~
@1331  = ~This is where the diviner stays during the day. I'll wait here until you finish talking with the diviner.~
@1332  = ~I thought you said you would help? We have little time, hurry!~
@1333  = ~What were you doing?! You asked the wrong question! You idiot, now we're all dead.~
@1334  = ~You should go to the Water Queen's House. It's also known as the temple of Umberlee. I'll be at the Blade and Stars Inn. Meet me there when you've found a way to reverse the geas.~
@1335  = ~So, how did you fare? Do you have the cure to my geas?~
@1336  = ~What are you doing here then?! Go back and find the cure to the geas; there isn't much time.~
@1337  = ~All right then, here's my half of the antidote. Marek, my partner, possesses the other half of the antidote. You'll find him at the Blushing Mermaid inn. I can't help you other than that.~
@1338  = ~We don't have time to listen to an assassin of the Iron Throne.~
@1339  = ~We'll give you a chance. Make it quick.~
@1340  = ~Why don't we just kill you and take the antidote ourselves?~
@1341  = ~Okay, what do you want us to do?~
@1342  = ~Don't try to lie to us, scum!~
@1343  = ~Okay, we'll help you.~
@1344  = ~We don't need your help, assassin.~
@1345  = ~We don't have the money, and we're not interested in dealing with an assassin.~
@1346  = ~Sorry, but you can find someone else; we can find this antidote on our own.~
@1347  = ~We'll help you. Take us to this diviner.~
@1348  = ~Sorry, we can't help you.~
@1349  = ~Okay, we've changed our minds, we'll help you. Take us to this diviner.~
@1350  = ~No, we don't.~
@1351  = ~We have your cure, now where is the antidote to the poison?~
@1352  = ~You wish to hear the arcane knowledge of Haspur? It will cost you 50 gold for the answers to your questions no matter how small. Will you pay, or will you leave?~
@1353  = ~I am for real. Now what is it that you wish to know? I must tell you, I only have the strength to answer a single question in a day, so be careful in what you ask.~
@1354  = ~They are led by Rieltar Anchev.~
@1355  = ~They are led by Sarevok Anchev.~
@1356  = ~Only the high priestess Jalantha Mistmyr of Umberlee has the power to remove Lothander's geas. She can be found at the Water Queen's House. It is difficult to see whether or not she will help you.~
@1357  = ~Entar Silvershield is the wealthiest man in the city. He keeps his hoard in his bedroom at his estate.~
@1358  = ~The man who claims to heal him is, in fact, the source of the problem.~
@1359  = ~A man named Sarevok Anchev is responsible for the frame.~
@1360  = ~I cannot answer any more questions. You must leave now.~
@1361  = ~Making money has always been their agenda.~
@1362  = ~50 gold! That's ridiculous, you can find some other chumps to squeeze money out of.~
@1363  = ~Here's the money, seer, but you'd better be for real.~
@1364  = ~Who is the leader of the Iron Throne?~
@1365  = ~What is the Iron Throne's agenda?~
@1366  = ~Who is the richest man in Baldur's Gate, and where does he keep all of his money?~
@1367  = ~Who has the ability to release Lothander of his geas?~
@1368  = ~Why is Eltan so ill?~
@1369  = ~Who framed us for the murder of the Iron Throne leaders?~
@1370  = ~Who is the leader of the Iron Throne?~
@1371  = ~Why you—~
@1372  = ~I am Jalantha Mistmyr. What reason do you have to see me?~
@1373  = ~I am the High Priestess Jalantha Mistmyr; you have come to worship at this temple, yet none of you bear any holy items of my goddess. Why are you here?~
@1374  = ~Your faith comes across falsely. When you decide to tell me the truth, then you may speak with me again.~
@1375  = ~I do not offer the power of my goddess to anyone. If you wish this favor you will first have to do a favor for Umberlee.~
@1376  = ~My goddess cannot be bought with gold. If you wish to see your friend healed, you will first have to do a favor for Umberlee.~
@1377  = ~The favor I ask of you is a simple one. The holy day Storm Call approaches. It will be the first time I have overseen this ceremony. To ensure that my first ceremony is flawless, I need an item of power. It is called the Book of Wisdom, and it is possessed by the clergy of Tymora at the Temple of Tymora, called the Lady's Hall by those who venerate the frivolous goddess. If you can get this book for me, I will do what you ask. What is your decision?~
@1378  = ~I don't care how you get the book. Once you have it, come to the temple and meet with me.~
@1379  = ~So, you've returned with the Book of Wisdom. Let me see it.~
@1380  = ~You don't have it?! Then return to me when you do. Now leave.~
@1381  = ~You dare question my honor! Very well, this scroll is scripted with the incantation that will rid your friend of his curse. Now give over the book.~
@1382  = ~Good. Take this. An incantation upon this scroll will dispel the geas upon your companion.~
@1383  = ~You will pay for such impudence!~
@1384  = ~Our bargain is now finished, I would ask you to leave.~
@1385  = ~We have come to pay our respects at your temple.~
@1386  = ~We have need of your powers. A companion of ours is cursed with a geas spell. We humbly ask that you remove it.~
@1387  = ~We want you to remove a geas spell from a companion of ours. We will pay any price.~
@1388  = ~We did not lie, we are here to pay our respects to your goddess.~
@1389  = ~You're right. We're not here to worship; rather, we need the power you possess. A friend of ours is afflicted by a geas spell. Would you be able to remove it from him?~
@1390  = ~We need you to remove a geas spell from one of our companions. Name your price.~
@1391  = ~We don't like your offer. We'll be off now.~
@1392  = ~It looks as if we have no other choice; we're in.~
@1393  = ~We don't trust you. Before we show it to you, we want the cure to our friend's geas.~
@1394  = ~Here you go. Now give us the cure to the geas.~
@1395  = ~Actually, we don't have it with us right now.~
@1396  = ~Here's your precious book.~
@1397  = ~Actually, we don't have the book. Aren't you the fool?~
@1398  = ~For what purpose do you visit the Bitch Queen?~
@1399  = ~The High Priestess does not have time to see commoners. Why should I allow you to waste her time?~
@1400  = ~You are unwise to waste my time. Please leave.~
@1401  = ~You may not enter. I will not change my mind for you or any of your idiot friends. If you come up with a better reason to enter, then speak to me again.~
@1402  = ~I told you to follow me. I won't give you a second warning.~
@1403  = ~Such a piddling tribute. If you wish to see the High Priestess you will have to give at least 100 gold.~
@1404  = ~That offer is adequate. Wait here and I will return with the High Priestess.~
@1405  = ~You wish to see Tenya? Wait here and I will get her for you.~
@1406  = ~So, you've returned. Do you have the book for Jalantha?~
@1407  = ~Then return when you have the book!~
@1408  = ~Wait here, I will return with Jalantha.~
@1409  = ~We wish to speak with high priestess Jalantha Mistmyr.~
@1410  = ~We want to see what a temple to an evil goddess looks like on the inside. We're from, uh, Cormyr. Tourists, you know.~
@1411  = ~We wish to pay our respects to the Queen of the Deeps.~
@1412  = ~We wish to see the Priestess Tenya.~
@1413  = ~Perhaps a little donation to the church? Would 25 gold suffice?~
@1414  = ~Would a donation of 50 gold allow us entry?~
@1415  = ~I met the brother of the man I killed in Cloakwood, Aldeth I think his name was. Hmmm, I guess family ties run deep.~
@1416  = ~100 gold?! We can't afford that. You'll have to find other peasants to exploit.~
@1417  = ~Okay, here's your 100 gold.~
@1418  = ~No, we don't have it yet.~
@1419  = ~Yes, we have it with us.~
@1420  = ~Could we have a moment of your time?~
@1421  = ~Actually, we insist. We need to talk to you about your involvement with the Iron Throne.~
@1422  = ~Well, we tried to warn you.~
@1423  = ~First, let me introduce the two of us. I'm Marek and this is my companion, Lothander. I thought it would be nice for you to know our names, 'cause if you don't take our advice you'll be seeing more of us two. I know that you've been taking an active interest in destroying the Iron Throne, don't try to deny it. My companion and I are in the employ of the aforementioned Throne. We thought it would be polite to give you one last warning: Stop interfering with our employer's business. You can decide to disregard this warning, but if you do, it'll be the last decision you ever make. See ya later.~
@1424  = ~So you've come, I assume, to take the antidote. All you're going to accomplish is to hasten your death, but I think that isn't the foremost worry you have at the moment.~
@1425  = ~Not right now.~
@1426  = ~What is it?~
@1427  = ~Make all the threats you want. We aren't the ones with one foot in the grave. It's anybody stupid enough to get in our way who will pay the piper.~
@1428  = ~We're not interested.~
@1429  = ~All right, go ahead, what do you want?~
@1430  = ~Gee, thanks for the warning.~
@1431  = ~I am glad to see that you have come. I know that such a meeting is unusual, but in these circumstances it is necessary. I would first ask what involvement you have had with the merchant society known as the Iron Throne?~
@1432  = ~Perhaps I should reiterate: I command you to tell me what your involvement with the Iron Throne is.~
@1433  = ~Don't insult my intelligence with your lies. What is your involvement with the Iron Throne?~
@1434  = ~Don't force me to do something that I'll regret. You already know too much for me to just let you go. You WILL die if you do not tell me what I want to know. You have no option here.~
@1435  = ~From what I have been told, you have been quite a thorn in the side of the Iron Throne. I'm interested in you because of the obvious hatred that they hold for you. Their recent activities have been brought to my attention, and I am very dubious about the intent of the Throne. I think it is far too easy to blame the recent caravan raids and iron shortage on the Zhentarim. Though the evidence does point to them, they do not have much to profit, while the Iron Throne has everything to gain. I have much to concern me right now, especially with tension rising between our city and the nation of Amn. Unfortunately, my hands are tied; I can't act against the Iron Throne until I have hard evidence of their wrongdoing. That's, of course, where you come in. I need a small group of spies to break into the Iron Throne headquarters and see if they can find any proof of the Throne's involvement with the caravan raids. If you do this for me, you'll be paid extremely well: 2,000 gold to divide among yourselves. What is your answer?~
@1436  = ~I'm sorry to hear that.~
@1437  = ~You have made a wise decision. It is a difficult mission that I give you, but I am sure that you have the wherewithal to make it through. Return and report to me once you feel you have enough information to use against the Iron Throne.~
@1438  = ~I am glad to have you back. So, what have you learned so far?~

@1535  = ~He's been staying at a place called the Low Lantern. It's the playground for the wicked and depraved, a ship where prostitutes ply their trade. All I want you to do is find him and take his spellbook. I have enough magical skill to reverse the curse if I had the formula for his spell.~

@1663  = ~You talked to me, loudmouth. Go see Kelddath if you have temple business. Get off my clean floor.~
@1664  = ~Get off my floor. Nothin' gonna mess my nice clean floor.~
@1665  = ~Do you remember me? I am the one who told you that the personal healer of Duke Eltan is not what he seems. True, those were not my exact words, but seeing that you have done nothing, I thought it prudent to reiterate in your minds what you should be doing.~
@1666  = ~It is stupid for you to attack me, I am not the enemy. I will forget this one act of foolishness on your part.~
@1667  = ~Just follow the healer when he leaves the Flaming Fist stronghold. He leaves at midnight every night. If you follow him, you'll learn his true identity. Remember, don't kill him immediately, otherwise they'll just send another one in the exact form. If you can kill him in full view of Eltan, then the duke will be alerted to the real identity of his healer.~
@1668  = ~Hello again. I have been searching for you for some time now.~
@1669  = ~Do you now trust what I say? You found out for yourselves that the healer was an assassin. I have new information for you.~
@1670  = ~I have more information that you may wish to hear.~
@1671  = ~Before I tell you anything more you must make me a promise.~
@1672  = ~You must promise me that you will defeat Sarevok, the man behind all of your woes. You must destroy his plans, stop his mad scheme in its tracks. You must strip him of dignity and pride, but you must not kill him. You must promise me that. Without my help you'll never defeat him, he is a better man than you. Promise me you'll spare his life in defeat, and I will give you what you need to defeat him.~
@1673  = ~NO QUESTIONS! It is enough, what I have told you, I will tell you no more. Now what is your decision?~
@1674  = ~You'll never kill Sarevok, stupid fools. Now you've forced my hand. Damn you, and damn all your kind.~
@1675  = ~You need to go to the Undercellar. There you will find Slythe and Krystin. They are the assassins who have killed Entar Silvershield and have tried to kill you. If you kill them, you'll be able to learn much. I can tell you no more, except that you should hurry. Time runs short.~
@1676  = ~You lied to me! I told you not to lie to me. You were to leave him alone. He hates me now because of my betrayal. He finally figured it out. After all, he couldn't believe that a pathetic group such as you could undo all of his plans. Now he hates me, went berserk in fury, tried to kill me. Now I have to kill you. I have to make it up to him.~
@1677  = ~I thought I could save him from his own sick plot; he would have died if he won, or at least he'd no longer be human, I'd have lost him. But now all he holds for me is hatred. I have to erase that hatred.~
@1678  = ~I'll do what I want with my life. Now defend yourselves.~
@1679  = ~We should get doors. They swiped the chairs. Nice floor though.~
@1680  = ~I have things that must be said, things that are important to us both. I have but one condition to my discourse, and you must agree before I speak. A promise I seek, and I will accept no less.~
@1681  = ~Yes, <SIRMAAM>, spiffy floor.~
@1682  = ~Save successful~
@1683  = ~My promise will not harm you, though ignoring it can. Indeed, my information can only benefit. You will gain if you did not know it before, and you will gain if you knew it but needed it confirmed. The choice I pose is the only option. Are you in agreement or not?~
@1684  = ~What do you want us to do? Who is this healer?~
@1685  = ~We understood you the first time.~
@1686  = ~We make no promises, lady, for anybody.~
@1687  = ~What promise do we have to make?~
@1688  = ~We don't need your help, wench. We're going to kill the murdering bastard when we find him.~
@1689  = ~You have our word, we'll spare his rotten life.~
@1690  = ~Why would you care if he lived or died?~
@1691  = ~Yes, we agree.~
@1692  = ~We're going to kill Sarevok and kill him but good. Sorry, no deal.~
@1693  = ~Now wait one moment, Tamoko, why not just leave Sarevok to his own fate? Don't throw away your life.~
@1694  = ~Why the hell did you betray him in the first place?~
@1695  = ~Sure, if you want to die, we're ready to help you along.~
@1696  = ~Nester's Dagger~
@1697  = ~A Key~
@1698  = ~Hey there travelers, y'all seem rather road worn. Perhaps there's a reason for that, eh? Well, I shan't come across as rude. My name's Tomlin, and I'm the owner of a small trading coster that operates out of Beregost. Who do you happen ta be?~
@1699  = ~Ya needn't be so rude, I'll be on my way then.~
@1700  = ~Ha ha, I think there's more to you than that. I recognize you from all the wanted posters that have been put up. I think if you guys want to get into the big city, you're going to need some help. Lucky for you, I can give you that help, for a price.~
@1701  = ~So you are the guys who've been stirring up all the trouble in the region. There's wanted posters out for you all over. So where are you guys headed now?~
@1702  = ~If that's the way you want to be, I guess I'll be on my way.~
@1703  = ~It's too bad we're going opposite directions. I guess I should be going now.~
@1704  = ~You'll never make it into Baldur's Gate without some help. You're wanted men now, and as such I can offer up my services to help you into the big city. It'll cost you, but will definitely be worth it.~
@1705  = ~How should I know? Do you want my help or not?~
@1706  = ~I'm a smuggler. I smuggle illicit goods from Amn into Baldur's Gate. If you pay me 100 gold, I'll smuggle the lot of you into the big city.~
@1707  = ~What you can do then, is to follow me into town. I will take care of you, and you won't have any problems at all. I hope you don't have any difficulties with my instructions.~
@1708  = ~Aren't you coming. It doesn't bother me a bit, you've already paid, after all.~
@1709  = ~That wasn't too hard, now, was it? Guess there wasn't the large guard contingent that I thought there would be. Well, I wish you all the gods' luck in the city. You're going to need it. Bye now.~
@1710  = ~We're just travelers, on our way to Baldur's Gate.~
@1711  = ~We're adventurers, fighting against the depravity of the Iron Throne.~
@1712  = ~It's none of your concern.~
@1713  = ~We don't need any of your help.~
@1714  = ~How can you help us?~
@1715  = ~How did wanted posters of us get around so fast?~
@1716  = ~None of your business, we'll be on our way now.~
@1717  = ~We're headed to Baldur's Gate.~
@1718  = ~We're headed to Amn.~
@1719  = ~How did wanted posters get put up so fast?~
@1720  = ~We don't need your help.~
@1721  = ~In what way could you help us?~
@1722  = ~No! We don't need your help.~
@1723  = ~Okay, how are you going to help us get into Baldur's Gate.~
@1724  = ~We can find our own way into the city.~
@1725  = ~100 gold, we can afford that.~
@1726  = ~Wait! I must speak with you; it's of utmost importance. Will you wait and listen?~
@1727  = ~Well, then make time! I must speak with you!~
@1728  = ~I didn't realize Gorion had raised such a rude child.~
@1729  = ~Good then. I am Delthyr. I represent those who harp. I have been seeking you out for many weeks now. Just recently I discovered that you had left the city some time ago. Things have changed since you were gone, I can tell you everything you need know.~
@1730  = ~Uhhhh huh.~
@1731  = ~The second-in-command of the Flaming Fist, Scar, was assassinated. Grand Duke Eltan has come down with some mysterious ailment. No one knows how long he has to live. The most important news for you concerns your recent return to Candlekeep. You've been accused of murdering the leaders of the Iron Throne. Everyone believes that you are agents of Amn. They think your persecution of the Iron Throne was just a cover-up for Amn. Tensions run pretty high right now. The new Iron Throne president, Sarevok, has placed a price on all of your heads. The Flaming Fist has a warrant for your arrest. Before I continue, tell me, are you guilty?~
@1732  = ~Killing is never the answer to anything; your father should have taught you that. Nevertheless, it is in the past. We must talk of your future.~
@1733  = ~I am relieved. Now we must speak of your future.~
@1734  = ~From what our network has gathered, the Iron Throne is preparing to make a grab for power in Baldur's Gate. It would be in your best interest to investigate what they're up to. Perhaps if you could break into their citadel, you might learn something. I know these are very troubled times for you, but you know more about the Iron Throne than anyone else. If you have any questions for me, ask them now, I'll be gone for the next few days.~
@1735  = ~From the evidence found where he was murdered, it would seem that the Shadow Thieves killed him. I think that it is far too convenient to lay the blame on that organization. I would assume that the Iron Throne remains involved in some way.~
@1736  = ~The Shadow Thieves are an extensive organization of thieves and assassins that has power bases all along the Sword Coast. Its main base of operation, however, is located in Amn.~
@1737  = ~The signature mask and stiletto were left on Scar's body.~
@1738  = ~So far Eltan's healer has been unable to discover what has been ailing him. It must be magical in nature. I find the whole affair rather strange. From what I know, Eltan's healer, Rashad, was a priest of no mean faith and power. It is unusual that he has been unable to effect a cure for the Grand Duke.~
@1739  = ~If that is the last of your questions, then I must be off. If you must see me again, I'll be at the Three Old Kegs inn.~
@1740  = ~Hello again! It's me, Delthyr. I hope things have been going well. I have much to tell you.~
@1741  = ~Have you investigated Duke Eltan's mysterious illness? I would suggest that you investigate Rashad, his personal healer. Rashad leaves the Flaming Fist barracks every night. Follow him and see if there is any truth to my suspicions.~
@1742  = ~I've learned that two assassins have been operating in the city. They're both members of the Night Masks out of Westgate. I think they're working for Sarevok. From what I've learned they've been staying at the Undercellar. It would be good for you to check it out.~
@1743  = ~We don't have time.~
@1744  = ~What is it you want?~
@1745  = ~Don't get your panties in a knot. What do you want?~
@1746  = ~We don't have to make time for no one.~
@1747  = ~Hey, wait. You knew Gorion? Well then, we have something to talk about.~
@1748  = ~Ya, well I guess I turned out to be a bad apple.~
@1749  = ~No, we've already found out through other sources.~
@1750  = ~No, we like to operate with no knowledge of the world around us. Duh?!~
@1751  = ~That would be most welcome.~
@1752  = ~Yep, those scum deserved everything coming to them.~
@1753  = ~No, we were framed.~
@1754  = ~Who killed Scar?~
@1755  = ~What sickness has Eltan come down with?~
@1756  = ~We don't have any questions right now.~
@1757  = ~Who are the Shadow Thieves?~
@1758  = ~What clues incriminated the Shadow Thieves?~
@1759  = ~What sickness has Eltan come down with?~
@1760  = ~That's enough questions for now.~
@1761  = ~So, do you have any other questions?~
@1762  = ~Who are the Shadow Thieves?~
@1763  = ~What clues incriminated the Shadow Thieves?~
@1764  = ~What sickness has Eltan come down with?~
@1765  = ~That's enough questions for now.~
@1766  = ~Gardush~
@1767  = ~Gardush~
@1768  = ~You there! It's good to see my Zhentish pals again.~
@1769  = ~You there! It's good to see my Zhentish pals again.~
@1770  = ~You there! It's good to see my Zhentish pals again.~
@1771  = ~The Black Network sends its regards. Since my associates haven't yet, I'll introduce myself: I'm Kolvar. I've come down from Darkhold to see how things have been faring. Semmemon isn't very pleased at how the Zhentish name has been being falsely used. We have a bad enough rep as it is, without all the rest of the crap that's been going on down here. So tell me, is it true that you killed the leaders of the Iron Throne?~
@1772  = ~A rather sloppy job, I might say. If you're going to off someone, a little more subtlety needs to be used.~
@1773  = ~That's too bad.~
@1774  = ~It seems the majority of the high-ups here in the Gate feel that you were working for Amn at the time of the assassinations. Seems to me that someone really wants to get Baldur's Gate paranoid about Amn. It's working really well. There's been talk all over the streets about how Amn is "ready to invade," a load of crap if you ask me. If you haven't heard yet, Scar, second-in-command of the Flaming Fist, was assassinated while you were at Candlekeep. The Grand Duke Eltan has been infected by some sort of magical disease; so far his healer has been unable to do anything about it. From what I've been hearing, I think that Sarevok, the new Iron Throne leader, is trying to make a grab for power in Baldur's Gate. I'd suggest that you investigate this "Sarevok." Perhaps you should break into the Iron Throne citadel. Do you have questions? 'Cause if you do, ask now; I'm on my way out of town to report to the bigwigs in Darkhold.~
@1775  = ~Most of the evidence point to the Shadow Thieves. The Shadow Thieves are a huge criminal organization that has its base in Amn. The signature of the Shadow Thieves, a stiletto and mask, was found on Scar's body.~
@1776  = ~I don't have any real knowledge, though I am suspicious of Rashad, Eltan's personal healer. He's a powerful priest; you'd think he would have a found a way to heal the Grand Duke by now.~
@1777  = ~Well, that's all; I have to be going. I hope things go well for you.~
@1778  = ~We did, and with some pleasure.~
@1779  = ~We had nothing to do with it; we were framed.~
@1780  = ~Do you know who killed Scar?~
@1781  = ~Do you have any knowledge as to how Eltan was infected?~
@1782  = ~We don't have any questions.~
@1783  = ~It is good to see you all again, friends. I've been hearing quite a few rumors about you, all of which are undoubtedly untrue.~
@1784  = ~So, do you know all the rumors flying about town? Seems people think you're Amnian spies, and that you've murdered the leaders of the Iron Throne. Does any of that have any truth to it?~
@1785  = ~That's too bad, I cannot harbor criminals. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.~
@1786  = ~Guards! Will you please escort these unwanted guests from the premises?~
@1787  = ~I'm glad to hear it. I never took any of you to be the murderin' type. Well then, have you heard all the other rumors flying about the city? Seems that Commander Scar of the Flaming Fist has been assassinated. Even worse, Grand Duke Eltan has come down with some sort of magical illness. It was those two who first hired you to save my company from the wretched doppelgangers, so I owe them a lot. Do you think you'd be up to investigate what's wrong with Duke Eltan? I know it'd be tough with you wanted and all, but there's no one else who I think is up to the job.~
@1788  = ~Well, I guess there's nothing more to talk about; perhaps we'll meet again.~
@1789  = ~I think it would be best to investigate the site where Scar was murdered. He was killed at the Blushing Mermaid tavern. I have no idea why he was there, but if you do some questioning you might learn something.~
@1790  = ~I don't have anything more for you at the moment. I wish you luck.~
@1791  = ~I'm disappointed, but I guess that's how things have to be.~
@1792  = ~Not a bit, we were framed.~
@1793  = ~We killed the Iron Throne leaders, they had it coming.~
@1794  = ~I don't think we're up to it. Sorry.~
@1795  = ~What is it exactly that you want us to do?~
@1796  = ~We'll look into it. Do you have anything more for us?~
@1797  = ~Doesn't sound like a promising enough lead. We have other things on our agenda; we'll have to pass up on this one.~
@1798  = ~Your offer is fair. Consider it done.~
@1799  = ~It's not worth my time, but with a little extra gold...~
@1800  = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested.~
@1801  = ~Perhaps I shall after all.~
@1802  = ~I've made my decision. Now get someone else.~
@1803  = ~She will trouble you no more.~
@1804  = ~This... priestess had much to say about the group of you.~
@1805  = ~She's more powerful than you said. But if you sweeten our deal...~
@1806  = ~I'll have no more part in this! I don't trust any of you!~
@1807  = ~Perhaps I shall after all.~
@1808  = ~I've made my decision. Now get someone else.~
@1809  = ~I have reconsidered your offer and accept.~
@1810  = ~I have made my decision known.~
@1811  = ~Upon careful reconsideration, I have decided to accept your offer.~
@1812  = ~The child has said that you killed her mother and have been taking far too much from the seas. I don't like being used, Sonner. It makes me... angry.~
@1813  = ~I canna get a straight answer from any of you. I am done here!~
@1814  = ~Upon careful reconsideration, I have decided to accept your offer.~
@1815  = ~The child has said that you killed her mother and have been taking far too much from the seas. I don't like being used, Sonner. It makes me... angry.~
@1816  = ~I canna get a straight answer from any of you. I am done here!~
@1817  = ~Oh... that is truly heartwarming of you! Could you then get on with it? No rush or anything, it's just our LIVES!~
@1818  = ~Give me the bowl, Sonner. I'll not ask so nicely a second time!~
@1819  = ~Give me the gold, and I'll finish my job.~
@1820  = ~I'm done with all of this. Find yourselves another tool.~
@1821  = ~I know not of whom you speak, child.~
@1822  = ~Uhhh... they did send me, but I wish only to know what is going on.~
@1823  = ~It's true! They sent me to end your villainous deeds!~
@1824  = ~Ummmm... they did send me, but I wish only to know what is going on.~
@1825  = ~What goes on is none of your business! Leave now, lest you earn the same fate that they have!~
@1826  = ~You return?! I warn you once again to leave my home. If you do not, I must assume you are allied with my enemies!~
@1827  = ~I have retrieved the child's body from the Umberlee temple. It was a stroke of luck that Tenya was there, though I feel no better about being used before.~
@1828  = ~They did send me, but I wish only to know what is going on.~
@1829  = ~It's true! They sent me to end your villainous deeds!~
@1830  = ~I wish no enmity between us, and will not disturb you further.~
@1831  = ~Shhh, child. I shall help as best I can.~
@1832  = ~I don't trust you OR Sonner's bunch.~
@1833  = ~You would say anything to save yourself. I'll not believe it!~
@1834  = ~Then stand you well outside the battle and leave me be! It is but money that makes this fight yours! A petty reason, by any account! Begone!~
@1835  = ~They are all dead, and will trouble you no more. Does this satisfy your need for vengeance?~
@1836  = ~Here is the bowl that was taken from your mother. Perhaps now she will rest.~
@1837  = ~I have not yet retrieved the bowl or dealt with Sonner.~
@1838  = ~I have returned to finish what I started. Your evil ways must end!~
@1839  = ~I'll have nothing more to do with any of you! I will be no one's tool.~
@1840  = ~Well. I should say the mother and I expected to see you again at some point, though it was certainly not to be so soon. I suppose it's to collect some sort of payment for your actions in Beregost, hmmm?~
@1841  = ~To what dishonor do we owe your violating our temple? Is it not you who served Umberlee in Beregost? Such a promising introduction to be followed by your breaking onto our sacred ground. State your purpose here!~
@1842  = ~You do not ask for much, do you? Very well, take the child and go. I warrant you will no doubt resurrect him, but the lesson is learned. Death changes one, especially one so young. I know of this like no other. GO! And never darken these halls again... unless summoned!~
@1843  = ~Ha! Hahahaha. It's an interesting, and foolishly LARGE request from someone in your position. Umberlee neither required, nor sought your help. You were simply a toy for her amusement. Perhaps you can be such again? Since you did some service, needed or not, you have a small chance to leave. Here is the body you came for. If you can get to the front gate, you may leave. If you do not make it, you will join him. Even if you live, I trust I shall never see you again. Understand? Waveservants! You have heard the challenge! If they escape... you WILL die!~
@1844  = ~I suppose such brash and disrespectful behavior is to be expected from such a bloodthirsty lot. Very well, you may have the body you came for. No doubt you will raise him, but he will have learned. By this time Umberlee herself may have had a chat with him. Oh, one other thing... NEVER come here again unless summoned.~
@1845  = ~Pathetic. Whether true or not, it simply would not do for people to think Umberlee requires the assistance of such sniveling worms as yourselves. You seek the child? Here is the body. It is a simple game. You get as far as the front gate, you are worthy to have served the Water Queen and may take what you came for. If you do not get there, well, you shall be beyond worrying about it. Oh, and if you think our waveservants may just let you pass? ATTENTION! The Sea Queen demands a test! If these intruders live... the ranks will be CLEANSED!~
@1846  = ~I wish nothing of you, save the body of the fool that tried to break into your hallowed halls. I imagine the return of such an infidel is ample return for my services.~
@1847  = ~I demand the payment I am due for helping your cause! You and your Umberlee would not have prevailed without my help, and 'twas said you would repay me in time!~
@1848  = ~Please, I beg of you. I have but one wish and then I will go. There is a child who came here and was killed. I simply hope to obtain his body. Then I shall trouble you no more.~
@1849  = ~I demand the payment I am due for helping your cause! You and your Umberlee would not have prevailed without my help, and 'twas said you would repay me in time!~
@1850  = ~I wish nothing of you, save the body of the fool that tried to break into your hallowed halls. I imagine the return of such an infidel is ample return for my services.~

@1855  = ~I demand the payment I am due for helping your cause! You and your Umberlee would not have prevailed without my help, and 'twas said you would repay me in time!~
@1856  = ~You! Is it nerve that brings thee here?! No, more likely stupidity. Was it not you who turned thy back on Umberlee's cause in Beregost? You have changed somewhat but it is you. I see with the mother's eyes! Your inaction was of little consequence, for the mother and I dealt well with all of them. Now you will join them!~
@1857  = ~I meant no ill on you or your temple! Please, I beg of you! It is a mission of mercy I am on! I seek the body of a child killed here. The child's parent does miss him so!~
@1858  = ~It was not my fight. Far be it from me to get in the path of your righteous fury. My purpose here now hath no more inconvenience than when we last met. You have the body of a child here. Your justice has been dealt, and now I have come to take him home.~
@1859  = ~Cease your blubbering. It is an insult to show such pathos in the sight of Umberlee! Perhaps we should make ye prove your mettle, that we might forget this sickening display? The body you seek shall be at the front gate. Get there and it is yours to do with as you see fit. Of course my fellow waveservants will do their utmost to hinder your progress. It is sure to be an amusing diversion for the Sea Queen.~
@1860  = ~Do they now? It is not unlike how a child would miss its parent I imagine... Take him and begone. Do not expect such charity in the future, and do not return to this place unless summoned!~
@1861  = ~Some sage words indeed. You know your place in things well. Appropriate behavior should not go unrewarded. Here be the body you seek. No doubt your intention is to resurrect the child? No matter. The lesson will have been learned. Do not return here unless summoned. You shall find the reception more... chilling.~
@1862  = ~Do you not realize where you are? This is my very lair! This is the seat of Umberlee! You do not make demands here! Waveservants, dispose of this flotsam! I cannot stand the sight of them!~
@1863  = ~It's a bloodthirsty job you have, and we like the killin'! Let us join and the roads will run red 'neath our feet!~
@1864  = ~You're too good at your job! We can see which way the wind is blowing, and whatever you're doing, we want in. It's the only real profit on the Sword Coast today.~
@1865  = ~You'll not take us alive!~
@1866  = ~We don't want any trouble. Take what you want and leave us be.~
@1867  = ~You'll not take us alive!~
@1868  = ~We don't want any trouble. Take what you want and leave us be.~
@1869  = ~You'll not take us alive!~
@1870  = ~We don't want any trouble. Take what you want and leave us be.~
@1871  = ~Blast it all Raiken, what are you doing bringing prisoners here?! We've not the space to hold 'em, nor the men to watch 'em!~

@2101  = ~-buuurp- What da ya want?~
@2102  = ~Nope, don't know nuthin'.~
@2103  = ~I don't know nuthin'. Just leave me alone.~
@2104  = ~What can I do for you?~
@2105  = ~I know it was Commander Scar that went and got killed. The man who killed him left some sort of mask with a stiletto stuck through it. Other than that, I don't really have much.~
@2106  = ~Hello there.~
@2107  = ~All I know was that Commander Scar got killed.~
@2108  = ~Hey, bugger off.~
@2109  = ~Hey, hey, hey, what can I do for ya?~
@2110  = ~Ya, I do. That crummy fella who killed Scar, well when he came in he was a man, but when he left he looked like he was a woman, as if he changed form or somethin'. Hey, if ya wanna know someone else to ask about it, go talk with beggar Jack across the street.~
@2111  = ~Alms for the poor. Alms.~
@2112  = ~Not much, de only thing I remembers on that day is some crazed woman runnin' out of the Blushin' Mermaid. She ran into that building over yonder, the one two houses to the right of de Mermaid. Will you give me some alms, alms for the poor, diseased, wounded, and starvin'?~
@2113  = ~Do you know anything of the murder that took place a few days ago at this establishment?~
@2114  = ~Could you please remove yourself from our path?~
@2115  = ~Do you know anything of the murder that took place a few days ago at this establishment?~
@2116  = ~Nothing.~
@2117  = ~Do you know anything of the murder that took place a few days ago at this establishment?~
@2118  = ~Hello.~
@2119  = ~Do you know anything of the murder that took place a few days ago at this establishment?~
@2120  = ~No, you have nothing you can do for us.~
@2121  = ~Do you know anything of the murder that took place a few days ago at this establishment?~
@2122  = ~Get out of our way, garbage!~
@2123  = ~Salutations, my dear fellows. It has been some time since I've seen you last. Troubled times have descended upon our beautiful city. Perhaps we should retire to the antechamber and discuss things.~
@2124  = ~So tell me about this rumor that you murdered the leaders of the Iron Throne.~
@2125  = ~I'm sorry, but a gentleman cannot harbor known criminals. It would have been a smear upon my honor.~
@2126  = ~Sorry, we don't have time to talk right now. We'll see you later.~
@2127  = ~Sounds good to us.~
@2128  = ~There's not much to tell.~
@2129  = ~We were framed. Someone else killed them.~
@2130  = ~We murdered the sons of bitches.~
@2131  = ~You backstabbing excuse for a manure pile, your honor is the least of your concerns!~
@2132  = ~We surrender.~
@2133  = ~Stop where you are! You're wanted for the murders of three citizens of this city. Surrender and you'll be given a fair trial.~
@2134  = ~Thank you, Aldeth, you've done an important service for your city.~
@2135  = ~So, these are the infamous murderers, finally brought to justice. I am Angelo, commander of the Flaming Fist. I will be your judge, jury, and executioner. Please pardon the cliche.~ [ANGEL01]
@2136  = ~There is some truth to your words. It is unfortunate that you speak them to me, because, as you probably intended, your words have caused me anger. Kill one of them! I don't care which one!~
@2137  = ~Addressing the greed in my soul; an admirable attempt, but destined to fail. I am not stupid enough to cross one such as Sarevok, I reserve that stupidity all to you.~
@2138  = ~Uhhh right. Guards, take these imbeciles away.~
@2139  = ~Now that we are done with all of these pleasantries, I will make my decision. I had thought hard and long on what sentence I should give if you should be delivered into my hands. The choice is an obvious one. For the charges of murder, theft, arson, rape, and many other assorted crimes, I declare that each of you shall be taken to the Bazaar, where you shall hang by the neck until you are dead.~
@2140  = ~Who is this who interrupts me?~
@2141  = ~I know no such person. You have either confused me with someone else, or you are addled in the mind. Guards! Take them to the prison cells.~
@2142  = ~Greetings, Shar-Teel. It seems that you have finally found friends that share tastes similar to your own. I won't answer any questions that you give me; the only reason I do this now is for what we have shared in the past, Shar. You will be blamed for the death of the guards, so I would hurry. Goodbye, Shar, I hope to never see you again.~
@2143  = ~You have recaptured the criminals? Good. You know the sentence. Carry it out with the utmost haste.~
@2144  = ~You aren't the commander of the Flaming Fist; that title belongs to Duke Eltan, someone who deserves it. You're a pretender, and a rather ugly and smelly one at that. A lobotomized gibberling would make a better leader than you.~
@2145  = ~Hey, come on now. We all know that you're in the employ of Sarevok. We'll pay you more if you let us go.~
@2146  = ~Laugh now, Angelo. When your arms and legs are severed and you're lying on the ground crying like a little baby, hee hee, then we'll see who has the last laugh.~
@2147  = ~Why are you doing this, Angelo?~
@2148  = ~Your daughter is who speaks to you, Angelo, or have you somehow forgotten?~
@2149  = ~Hey, you guys. Yeah, you in the other cell. Are you the group that's wanted for murder on three different counts? Don't try to deny it, I know it's you. Well, heh heh, my name's Neb.~
@2150  = ~Hey, I was just trying to be friendly.~
@2151  = ~Heh heh, I killed some little street urchins. They're such a clutter to this city, ya know? They scream good too, especially the little girls.~
@2152  = ~Oh yeah, lots of stuff. You know about Duke Eltan, don't ya? He's been diseased. That's why Angelo's in charge now. It would have been Scar, but he went out and got assassinated, heh heh. Ya, the city's gone downhill over the last week. Too bad, heh heh.~
@2153  = ~Who cares what your name is, Neb? Just shut up.~
@2154  = ~Neb, do you know what's been going on in the city lately?~
@2155  = ~So why are you in prison, Neb?~
@2156  = ~Filthy monster, shut your mouth.~
@2157  = ~So Neb, do you know what's been going on in the city lately?~
@2158  = ~~
@2159  = ~I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long. Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated, I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the harbormaster's building. The harbormaster is a good friend of mine. I can rest there until I'm fully recovered. Take anything you can from Rashad's body, we must make haste.~
@2160  = ~~
@2161  = ~~
@2162  = ~I should be safe here. In the meantime, you have quite the task ahead of you. If I'm right, the Iron Throne is going to stage a coup. You're the only ones who'll be able to stop them.~
@2163  = ~~
@2164  = ~All the more reason to kill! He'll have my skull for this! Kill them now! Better still, I do myself! I trust not you fools!~
@2165  = ~Save breath, waste breath, whatever you wish. You die either way!~
@2166  = ~Recruits?! Secret operation and you hire those you rob?! By the lower planes, why do we pay the Blacktalons to do stealth if you almost light signal fires?!~
@2167  = ~YOU DON'T THINK! I THINK! I question them myself and if they not as you say, you die too!~
@2168  = ~I say now I don't like you! Give me reason to not have you broth-boiled and use your skin to swaddle my small-kin! Who are you that I should let you join?!~
@2169  = ~I've never seen "simple" merchants armed as you are! It look more like kick-ass be your commodity! I think you lie to me! I THINK YOU DIE!~
@2170  = ~You talk big! Maybe I think you talk TOO big! Maybe I think we just see who get bruised! Put your sword where your mouth is, or I put MINE there!~
@2171  = ~Heh! You fight pretty good. Maybe you're not such weaklings. I think you make pretty good bandits. Okay, you have run of camp. I have business to do, but Ardenor and Taurgosz keep eyes on you!~
@2172  = ~Hmmm. Ye have some sense to ye, but I have many a strong back here already. What for I need you?!~
@2173  = ~NONE KNOW THIS! If you know, maybe it was you who did it! I take your heads back to see if you're recognized!~
@2174  = ~Ehhh...? You sure are big on words. You better be big on the battlefield too, 'cuz if you're not... you die. You have run of the camp. If I hear ONE bad thing from Ardenor and Taurgosz, I personally feed your livers to the crows!~
@2175  = ~I may not be the smartest man, but I know a blowhard braggart when I see one! I'm also not the one giving grief to the short-tempered, extremely large half-ogre! Put your sword where your mouth is, or I put MINE there!~
@2176  = ~I take a patrol and leave for mine tonight! Keep pressure on trade routes and there be extra gold for all when we are done! I leave soon.~
@2177  = ~~
@2178  = ~A fool you are! You have no brain to attack me with my bandits everywhere! Attack! I want these idiots dead!~
@2179  = ~conjurer~
@2180  = ~Who are you? What are you doing here?~
@2181  = ~So, you've figured out the truth, meat. It will do you little good. GUARDS! Before my guards get here, I should be able to deal with you myself.~
@2182  = ~Stupid primates. It was your last mistake to come here. GUARDS! Let us see how your vaunted skills perform against one who was born an assassin.~
@2183  = ~What are you doing following me, meat?! If you thought I was to be easy prey, you are gravely mistaken.~
@2184  = ~So you are the group that has been causing so much trouble. You must be sorry to hear how your friend Scar died. He screamed quite deliciously before he died. I'm sure you'll do the same.~
@2185  = ~You haven't won. There are more of us... many more. You will die, meat.~
@2186  = ~We know who you are.~
@2187  = ~Surrender yourself now. We know you have been poisoning the duke.~
@2188  = ~We're here to protect the duke.~
@2189  = ~We're not sure why we're here.~
@2190  = ~Hey, guys. Remember me, your old bud Husam? *hic* Iz so good to see ya all again. Lots has happenedz since ya were gone. Heh heh, ya I've beens hearing all sortsa things. I heards you guys are wanted for murders. Hah, so yers murderers, eh? Well, I still like ya. Hey, I have somore info for yas. Do ya want ta hear it?~
@2191  = ~What?! I'ms not drunk, ya got me confused wit' somebody else.~
@2192  = ~Well, heh heh, quites a bit I have, quites a bit. Does ya know about Duke Eltan, he's diseased heez is. His seconds in command *hic* Scar got killed, assassassinated heez was. *buuuuuurp* Sose that's it. I gots to get going now, if you wants to talk with me some more just come by the Elfsong. See yas.~
@2193  = ~-buuurp- Hey again. Iz me, Husam. I gotta talk to yas. Jez follow me.~
@2194  = ~Sorry for misleading you, but there are times when subtlety works better than honesty. My associates and I don't want a fight, so we could ease the tension if all of us sheathed our weapons.~
@2195  = ~Okay then. First off, my name really is Husam. I have never owned a business in Baldur's Gate. My associates and I belong to an organization called the Shadow Thieves; I'm sure you've heard of us. I'm here in the Gate because of the lies being spread about our organization and the nation of Amn as a whole. I'm sure you're aware how you were framed as Amnian assassins while in Candlekeep, or how the deaths of Duke Entar Silvershield and Commander Scar were blamed on the Shadow Thieves. Well, we had nothing to do with it. It seems that someone is going to a lot of trouble to create a feeling of animosity between Baldur's Gate and Amn. Amn has never been interested in a war with this city and has definitely not been responsible for all of the troubles in this region. All of that can be placed squarely upon the shoulders of the Iron Throne, or more specifically Sarevok. Now that I've told you who I am, perhaps you can tell me who you are.~
@2196  = ~Mercenaries, huh. Well, your employer isn't in the best of shape right now, so perhaps you need some help.~
@2197  = ~The Zhentarim, an organization after my own heart. Well, we seem to have the same problem, so perhaps working together wouldn't be a bad thing.~
@2198  = ~Harpers. They seem to meddle in everyone's affairs.~
@2199  = ~Fair enough, but I do know that you're an enemy of the Iron Throne, and an enemy of an enemy is a friend.~
@2200  = ~I've been tracking the movements of two Night Masks who've been operating in the city over the past few weeks. I'd say they were responsible for framing the past several murders on the Shadow Thieves. I know they've been staying at a place called the Undercellar. How 'bout we pay them a visit.~
@2201  = ~Just follow us to the Splurging Sturgeon Inn, it has one of the entrances to the Undercellar.~
@2202  = ~Aren't you coming?~
@2203  = ~Here we are. The entrance is just in the back. We'll stay up here and run interference. The two you're looking for are named Slythe and Krystin. Meet us up here when you've dealt with the assassins.~
@2204  = ~How did you fare?~
@2205  = ~They should be down there; I had guards on all of the entrances. Go back and try again.~
@2206  = ~Good, did you find anything on their bodies?~
@2207  = ~That's happening tonight! If they succeed, Sarevok will have seized control of the entire city. We should move immediately; we have to get to the dukes before it's too late. Let's head to the palace now!~
@2208  = ~Here we are. From what I know, there's a secret entrance into the palace via the sewers. Unfortunately, it's heavily warded and guarded. That's where you come in. You'll have to disable the wards and traps. Once we're inside, we Shadow Thieves will create a diversion for the rest of you. You make your way to the election room, find out who the doppelgangers are, and kill them. Remember, make sure you know who the doppelgangers are. If you're right they'll revert to their true form; if you're wrong, you're in a heap of trouble. Here is where the location of the secret door is. It's all up to you.~
@2209  = ~Here's the secret entrance, it's up to you now. Get us through this without anyone dying.~
@2210  = ~We'd rather not get information from a drunken lunatic.~
@2211  = ~What do you have for us?~
@2212  = ~Sorry, Husam, we don't have time for your wacky antics right now.~
@2213  = ~Okay, show us where you want us to go.~
@2214  = ~We don't trust you one bit, prepare to defend yourselves.~
@2215  = ~Okay, we don't want a fight either, we'll give you a chance to explain yourself. The truth this time.~
@2216  = ~We're just mercenaries. We've been hired by Duke Eltan to investigate the Iron Throne.~
@2217  = ~We're currently operating with Zhentarim backing. They've had their identities misused as well.~
@2218  = ~We're working with Harper assistance.~
@2219  = ~You don't need to know who we are.~
@2220  = ~Sorry, we work alone.~
@2221  = ~Sorry, we work alone.~
@2222  = ~Sorry, we work alone.~
@2223  = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@2224  = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@2225  = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@2226  = ~Sorry, we work alone.~
@2227  = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@2228  = ~No thanks, we have other things to do than track down assassins (but we're not sure what).~
@2229  = ~Show us the way.~
@2230  = ~We killed both of them.~
@2231  = ~We didn't find anybody.~
@2232  = ~No, we didn't.~
@2233  = ~We found several documents spelling out their next assassination. They were to join with a group of doppelgangers to kill the two remaining Grand Dukes during the election.~
@2234  = ~All of you stop! We're not here to fight.~
@2235  = ~You there! Stop and throw down your weapons.~
@2236  = ~Give yourselves up. You're wanted for the murder of the Iron Throne leaders.~
@2237  = ~What are you doing here?!~
@2238  = ~You are beaten. Give yourselves up, and you'll get a fair trial.~
@2239  = ~Strip them! They are to be taken before commander Dosan.~
@2240  = ~The entry tax to the city is a copper per person. Please announce... Wait a second, you're the ones wanted for murder. GUARDS! They're here, the ones on the wanted posters!~
@2241  = ~Surrender and lay down your weapons.~
@2242  = ~Duke Eltan? The duke has been on his deathbed for the past week. Commander Angelo Dosan is in command now.~
@2243  = ~Commander Angelo Dosan, these are the men wanted for the murder of the Iron Throne leaders.~
@2244  = ~Only those with invitations are allowed entrance to the inauguration. Do you have invitations?~
@2245  = ~All right, you may enter.~
@2246  = ~You cannot come in the... Wait a minute, you're the ones wanted for murder. Surrender yourselves now.~
@2247  = ~There are the assassins! The men wanted for the murder of the Iron Throne leaders. Get them!~
@2248  = ~We'll give ourselves up to the likes of you when Hell freezes over.~
@2249  = ~Okay, we surrender.~
@2250  = ~Damn, you caught us. Take us to Duke Eltan, I'm sure that all of this can be sorted out.~
@2251  = ~No way!~
@2252  = ~Uh really, well we changed our minds. We no longer wish to surrender.~
@2253  = ~Well, take us to him then.~
@2254  = ~Yes, here you go.~
@2255  = ~Ahh, no we don't. So sorry.~
@2256  = ~You got us, we surrender.~
@2257  = ~Sorry, we have better things to do than go to prison.~
@2258  = ~We surrender!~
@2259  = ~No way!~
@2260  = ~We give up, just don't hurt us.~
@2261  = ~No chance of that, chumps.~
@2262  = ~As all of you know, this is a special occasion for the city of Baldur's Gate. It is time for a new person to join the ranks of the Grand Dukes. I do not wish to downplay the tragedy that we suffered with the loss of Entar Silvershield, but this is not the time for us to show grief.~ [LIIAJ01]
@2263  = ~The evidence we have about Entar's murder does resemble the work of the Shadow Thieves, but—~ [LIIAJ04]
@2264  = ~If I MAY continue, the signature left behind was very blatant and could have been put there to mislead all of us.~ [LIIAJ05]
@2265  = ~Thank you for saving us. You have our eternal gratitude. Is there anything I can do in return?~
@2266  = ~These are harsh accusations. Let me take a look at these documents you possess.~
@2267  = ~If you want to leave, you are free to go.~
@2268  = ~You are talking about a Grand Duke, do you have any proof to back up your claims?~
@2269  = ~I countermand that order. Wait until I have finished reading what is here.~
@2270  = ~I would ask that you do us one favor. It seems that you know Sarevok better than any of us. Would you hunt him down and end his threat?~
@2271  = ~It would seem to be in your best interest to hunt him down, after all he has threatened all of your lives.~
@2272  = ~I'm a mage of no small skill, so I can divine the location of where Sarevok's mage took him. If you just wait a few seconds, I should have the location.~
@2273  = ~Take a look at these documents we have. Sarevok is the one who tried to kill you, had Entar killed, and nearly killed Eltan.~
@2274  = ~Stuff it up your butt, old man.~
@2275  = ~Sarevok's the one who set you up to be killed. You have to kill him, now!~
@2276  = ~No, we don't.~
@2277  = ~Yes, we do. Take a look at these documents.~
@2278  = ~No way lady, we want to remain among the living.~
@2279  = ~We have many personal reasons for wanting to hunt him down. The only problem is trying to find him.~
@2280  = ~We've already given you our answer.~
@2281  = ~I guess we do, yes we'll hunt him down. Our only problem will be finding the bastard.~
@2282  = ~Now that all of our guests have arrived, we can begin with the ceremony that you have all been awaiting.~
@2283  = ~The votes have been tallied from those submitted by the landowners. The result was nearly unanimous.~ [BELTT04]
@2284  = ~All of your questions will be answered in due time; you need not worry.~ [BELTT05]
@2285  = ~Perhaps I could interject something before this meeting degenerates into meaningless bickering. We are here to welcome our new Grand Duke, so perhaps we should get on with it.~ [BELTT06]
@2286  = ~Introducing the new Grand Duke, Sarevok Anchev.~
@2287  = ~Wait one moment. That is not in your power to decide!~ [BELTT07]
@2288  = ~It was lucky that such brave people as yourselves intervened on our behalf. Is there anything that I can do for you in return?~
@2289  = ~I'll take a look, but if you're wrong, the punishment for such false accusations is severe.~
@2290  = ~You are free to go.~
@2291  = ~You can't just randomly shout accusations at a Grand Duke. Do you have any documents to back up these allegations?~
@2292  = ~These people are not to be touched until I have finished reading these documents.~
@2293  = ~I think it is in your best interest to hunt Sarevok and kill him before he does the same to you.~
@2294  = ~Through the power of my god, I should be able to divine his location. Just wait a moment, and I'll tell you where he has gone.~
@2295  = ~Take a look at these documents we have. Sarevok is the one who tried to kill you, had Entar killed, and nearly killed Eltan.~
@2296  = ~Sorry, we've been under a lot of pressure lately, and sometimes it affects our judgment.~
@2297  = ~Sarevok's the one who set you up to be killed. You have to kill him, now!~
@2298  = ~Yes, we do. Take them and read them.~
@2299  = ~No, we don't.~
@2300  = ~We've seen enough killing.~
@2301  = ~I think you're right. The only problem is finding the bastard.~
@2302  = ~What of Duke Eltan? Has his condition improved at all? If he dies, who will replace him?~ [PNOBL01]
@2303  = ~What about the rumors of Amn mobilizing for war? Why aren't we preparing for war?~ [PNOBL02]
@2304  = ~With our iron shortage, how are we to defend ourselves? Who will give us the iron we need?~ [PNOBL03]
@2305  = ~Entar was killed by Shadow Thieves, agents of Amn! If it isn't obvious to the rest of you, it's obvious to me: Amn wants a war!~ [PNOBL04]
@2306  = ~I believe that Eltan was poisoned by members of the Shadow Thieves. They're obviously trying to kill our leaders.~ [PNOBL05]
@2307  = ~Resembles?! That's ridiculous! The signature left behind on the body WAS the mark of the Shadow Thieves. Are you blind and stupid, woman?!~ [PNOBL06]
@2308  = ~Who would want to mislead us?!~ [PNOBL07]
@2309  = ~What of the Zhentarim? I've heard that they may be somehow involved.~ [PNOBL08]

@2311  = ~ASSASSINS, assassins in the palace!~
@2312  = ~Belt and Liia, they're dead, both of them are dead!~
@2313  = ~I am honored to be here before such a respected assemblage of noblemen. I accept my new position with full awareness to my new responsibilities, and I will have many of them.~
@2314  = ~I would first like to address many of the questions that had been asked earlier. The rumors about Amn's mobilization for war are entirely true, as is the involvement of their Zhentarim cohorts. But do not worry, we are not bereft of a defense. Although the recent Zhentish attempt at depriving us of the most valuable war resource, iron, has weakened us, it has not crippled us. When my father was most recently murdered, I inherited his control over the western branch of the Iron Throne. They have a great deal of stockpiled iron, enough for all of our needs. I will give this to the city to do with as you will. Unfortunately, our greatest military commander lies on his deathbed, a grievous blow to this city. To ensure that the Flaming Fist is well led, I will be assuming control of the mercenary regiment, with permission from its current steward, Angelo.~
@2315  = ~Instead of waiting for the war to come to us, we will take it to them. With the Flaming Fist, we should be able to easily take the town of Nashkel and then quickly fortify the mountain pass through the Cloud Peaks. What?! Who dares to interrupt?!~
@2316  = ~The Grand Dukes are dead, killed by assassins in our midst. Look there! The killers accused of murdering the leaders of the Iron Throne! They must be part of the plot. I don't want them alive! Kill them! Kill them all! You have FAILED, <CHARNAME>!~
@2317  = ~Angelo! They are the ones wanted on multiple counts of murder. KILL them!~
@2318  = ~You don't need to read that document, but since I know you're too stupid to take my advice, I'll just take your head.~
@2319  = ~You and I aren't finished yet, <CHARNAME>. I'll kill you, just as I killed Gorion. The only way you'll ever live in peace is if you kill me first.~ [SAREV02]
@2320  = ~You have come to your death, brother. You can't hide behind friends, this fight is between us. Our father would have wanted it this way, two sons of murder in a duel to the death. You are one of the strong; but then, we do share the same blood. Let us decide who is the stronger.~
@2321  = ~We're just a group of simple merchants on our way to Baldur's Gate. Your bandits tried to raid us, so we figured if we can't beat them, join them.~
@2322  = ~Ahh, go scare some school-girls. I could bruise you but good, and that's exactly why you need me!~
@2323  = ~We're strong, well armed, and we know opportunity when we see it! What better job be there for us? Dungeon crawling? That's fools' work!~
@2324  = ~Surely you must realize you need any help you can get, especially after losing Mulahey in the Nashkel mines.~
@2325  = ~Would you rather have too few and need more, or have too many and not need them at all?~

@2381  = ~I have a problem with morons armed to the teeth, poking through ruins, and stirring up creatures better left alone! Jokers like you blow through town with monsters in tow, and then out again leaving us locals to clean up the mess!~
@2382  = ~Oh, you think it's funny, do you?! You mess up the local economy with your treasure, you upset the balance of nature, you flash your magic around, and because of it maybe somebody's son thinks it's fun and goes out and gets himself killed!

@2432  = ~Welcome! The traveling adventurer is never turned away from a house of Lathander, as we strive to aid all who make a difference in the Realms. If you are battle-worn, we can extend a number of necromantic restorations, whatever your need. A small donation is all the compensation that we require.~
@2433  = ~Ye're in the wrong place, pal. I'd git out while ye're still able. I might not be able to stop a buncha well-armed adventurers, but if you cause any trouble in the guild, don't be expecting to walk out in one piece.~

@2435  = ~By the Morning Lord, I see that you have the holy symbol of Bassilus. It must have been a difficult battle to take down such a powerful man. Yours is a service that will not soon be forgotten. It is a pleasure to give you the full reward for which you have worked.~
@2436  = ~So you come here to claim the reward for the slaying of Bassilus. Good on you if this is true, but you must produce proof. Bring his Cyric holy symbol to me and you will be paid what you deserve. This is my word.~
@2437  = ~'Tis a great service you have done the people of this area, but it merely makes up for your previous acts of violence within these walls. You will get but 2,000 gold, and then you will leave my sight! Be thankful the guard does not place you in chains, let alone reward you!~
@2438  = ~I realize that it takes two to fight, but you took it too far. As soon as you used other means than your fists you were essentially using a weapon on an unarmed opponent. Now, because you were provoked you will be let off with only a fine, but if this happens again you'll be in the guardhouse!~
@2439  = ~It's unfortunate that people will often come to blows to settle their differences, but it is something we must live with. Ganging up on one man, however, is reprehensible! Now, because you were provoked, you will be let off with only a fine, but if this happens again you'll be in the guardhouse!~
@2440  = ~You must be powerful heroes to have brought down such a great beast. I will take the wyvern head and give you 2,000 gold for your troubles.~
@2441  = ~Without the beast's head, I cannot give you the reward. I hope you understand.~
@2442  = ~Hold your place right there! Brawling is one thing, but you use a blade or magic, and that is unreasonable force! You'll have to come with us for judgment before Kelddath Ormlyr. Follow, or we will force you!~
@2443  = ~Hold and lower your weapons! Brawling we could have overlooked, but stacking the odds by teaming up on one man is not a brawl, it's a beating! You'll have to come with us for judgment before Kelddath Ormlyr. Follow, or we will force you!~
@2444  = ~You there! Will you help a stranger in need? I am beset by gnolls!~
@2445  = ~The fight is joined, and I welcome your aid. Tiresome beasts these gnolls are, and I'll be glad to be done with them!~
@2446  = ~I see you standing out of the field of battle! Choose your side quickly, for I will be done forthwith and need to know whether to extend you my hand or my blade!~
@2447  = ~Enemies from the most surprising of sources, whenever I turn my head! I've no quarrel with you, so this must be your sport, and I have no quarter for those who kill for amusement!~
@2448  = ~With a Twinkle your life has ended, and such a waste it was.~
@2449  = ~Had you joined the battle, I would know whether you are well met or not. As it is, I will simply take my leave and avoid the issue altogether. You are one of the few who can say your meeting with Drizzt Do'Urden was uneventful, as friend or foe.~
@2450  = ~Well met, stranger, I am Drizzt Do'Urden, and I appreciate your assistance. It is a long enough trip to the Icewind Dale, even without these constant interruptions. I do not recall banditry being of such epidemic proportions in this area. How long has this been so?~
@2451  = ~Noble goals indeed, and ones I would hold dear myself. Your struggle will be difficult, for the bandits that I have encountered—being beset at every turn as I am—are no mere vagabonds with blades. The humans bear the style of the Blacktalon, and the hobgoblins that of the Chill. Mercenary groups both of them, and as such it is unlikely they are the architects of this endeavor. You would do well to insinuate into their ranks and determine their true masters. Difficult, but not impossible, and potentially the most fruitful course.~
@2452  = ~Such fuel burns hot and quick, but what of when it is spent? Attacking with hate may suffice, but it is by no means the most fruitful road to travel. These raiders of yours fight like mercenaries, and as such it is doubtful their bodies will give you more than the most cursory hint at who their masters are. Cool your fire, tread subtly, and you may find yourself closer to your true quarry. Be wary though, for the greater the potential reward, the greater the danger in acquiring it.~
@2453  = ~Would that it were my only battle to fight, but I doubt that, upon thinking carefully, you would truly want my help. Many a powerful creature view me as enemy. Would you truly wish to cross a balor's gaze? Your path is yours alone to follow. Just tread carefully, and remember that your sword is secondary to your mind. Your opponents may have a harder time matching your wit than your blade.~
@2454  = ~Well met, friend. Luck be on your side.~
@2455  = ~I will dismiss your ungratefulness as the impetuousness of youth and wish you the luck you will need.~
@2456  = ~Those that question my "edge" usually need but look deep inside themselves for their query's end. If you are lucky, my meaning is all you will catch. I take my leave.~
@2457  = ~Your assault upon me was without cause, but I leave you your life. See that you put it to better use.~
@2458  = ~You defy all reason! Make peace with your demons, and say hello to mine!~
@2459  = ~It was not always thus, and I strive to return peace to these lands.~
@2460  = ~The blasted raids are endless, as is my hatred for those behind them!~

@2517  = ~Good on you, friend. Come inside the Hall of Wonders, but please remember the 1 gold donation. It provides sponsorship for those that craft the curious wonders inspired by Gond. This patronage supports the... not immediately salable works produced.~
@2518  = ~1 gold, no talking, and please wipe your feet. The Hall of Wonders is open to all, but touch nothing while herein.

@2535  = ~I hope you had little difficulty making your way here. People are often confused by the companion building across the lane, the High House of Wonders.

@2539  = ~Here is a wondrous item forged from the mind of one of our respected gnomish brethren. Known as a Steam Dragon, it is a remarkable if somewhat noisy means of moving large objects. The fire in its belly powers mighty gears that can be affixed to belts and pulleys, hauling loads that would require dozens of strong backs. Our own harbor employs such items on a grand scale, relieving ships of their cargo in a matter of moments. A mite detrimental to the jobs of several longshoremen when installed, it has greatly improved the health of the few remaining.~
@2540  = ~Another marvel of ingenuity, the Pump of Gond. By standing astride the seat one is able to move water as a mill wheel might, with only the power of the legs. Excellent for watering fields or draining a flooded home. Hard work to ride for long, it does spare the back and neck from bearing the weight of buckets.~

The natural law that all must fall helps feed continuous oil to a system of lamp lights, eliminating bothersome refueling for weeks at a time. This is the enormous tank that holds the oil in reserve.

@2542  = ~Here be an amazement if ever there was one. Without question you have all seen a mariner's standard spyglass? That crude device that roughs out a coastline? It is but a shadow of this work of art from faraway Lantan. We are informed that it was labeled a "tell-a-scope" or some such when initially assembled, but we have taken to calling it a Farseer. A much more elegant name for its function and craftsmanship. The faces of the stars themselves are visible with its aid, and one is liable to run out of earth before running out of sight. Our local craftsmen have not been able to recapture Gond's original inspiration, and the inner workings remain a detailed mystery. Thus, while copies of its beauty are available, they function no better than the spyglass I mentioned.~
@2543  = ~I apologize, but I have to take my leave. I have duties in the temple, and must leave you to marvel on your own. Are there questions that I might answer before I go?~
@2544  = ~You spoke of the two halls being guarded as one. What did you mean by that?~
@2545  = ~At what time are the doors closed to the public, and when might they open?~
@2546  = ~Would it be possible to buy one of these items? What is their worth in gold?~
@2547  = ~Please continue the tour. Such items are incomprehensible without sage interpretation.~
@2548  = ~At what time are the doors closed to the public, and when might they open?~
@2549  = ~Please continue the tour. Such items are incomprehensible without sage interpretation.~
@2550  = ~Oh, it's a simple matter. With the halls conjoined, guards within one can pass to the other in a matter of moments. This is actually little needed, what with the extensive use of wards to keep out miscreants. Any number of guarding spells can be triggered by simply passing near one. Anything else?~
@2551  = ~Dawn to dusk we are open to viewing. We've a myriad of lighting, but our treasures are best viewed during daylight, when the eyes are open and the mind is fresh. Another inquiry?~
@2552  = ~I have hinted that flawed copies of items can be bought, but they must be ordered much in advance. Currently the wait is no less than a year. These originals on display are unavailable at any price, as the exact details of their construction are often lost to time. Apologies. Have you another query?~
@2553  = ~Forgive me, but I cannot dally about any longer. Duty calls, but enjoy your visit nonetheless. Please respect the needs of our other brethren as well, and leave with the falling of darkness. Many have nightly devotions that require their time, and they appreciate not having to hunt out stragglers.~
@2554  = ~By the Holy Maker of All Things, that knowledge was not to have passed beyond these walls! No offense to you, my good patron, but if you were able to hear of this then surely others have as well! I must see that the guard is doubled! Nay, tripled!~
@2555  = ~HELLO! SHHH! Shh... ah... um... I mean... hello. Might I have but a moment of your... ah... time? Ooh, this IS exciting isn't it? Oh, wait... You wouldn't think so. You're probably used to it.~
@2556  = ~Ah yes, well, um... you... you, ah... Oh, how do I approach this? You are... ah... for hire? I mean... ah... I need a... job done. Get my intent? A... JOB done. Strictly hush hush, I believe you would say.~
@2557  = ~You're not? Well, certainly it's most distressing, it is. A friend with more experience in these matters told me that this place, above all others, was where I should go. I need a particular type of person for... Well, no matter. You're obviously not interested. I shall look elsewhere.~
@2558  = ~As you will, but I shall be here some time if you change your mind. Ooh, this is SO naughty of me.~
@2559  = ~Certainly the guards are of some import, what with the wards not currently functioning in the High House.~
@2560  = ~Well then, have you time enough to speak with me now? I haven't found anyone suitable for my task yet. Tell me, would you be interested in a little... ah... after-dark shopping?~
@2561  = ~At what time are the doors closed to the public, and when might they open?~
@2562  = ~Would it be possible to buy one of these items? What is their worth in gold?~
@2563  = ~Please continue the tour. Such items are incomprehensible without sage interpretation.~
@2564  = ~I should like to procure your talents for a... ah... unique service, though it's not like you would have to do anything socially untoward. Well... perhaps a bit, though not so much untoward as... ah... illegal.~
@2565  = ~You spoke of the two halls being guarded as one. What did you mean by that?~
@2566  = ~Would it be possible to buy one of these items? What is their worth in gold?~
@2567  = ~Please continue the tour. Such items are incomprehensible without sage interpretation.~
@2568  = ~All I want is the acquisition of an item currently in the possession of someone else. It's not as though it's stealing. Well, actually it's a lot like stealing. Okay, it's stealing, but it's only the one item, and I don't want anybody hurt.~
@2569  = ~You spoke of the two halls being guarded as one. What did you mean by that?~
@2570  = ~Oh, of course! The bit o' coin to jog your memory! It's just as I imagined! Ohh, this is all just so naughty! Ahem... "Here mate, 'ows 5 gold get your attention?" Hee hee.~
@2571  = ~Oh, but you're a shrewd one! And such a fun game this is! "All right pardner, 5 more gold and not a silver more." Whee he he.~
@2572  = ~Hmmm, this game gets a tad repetitive now. Perhaps I can find someone who has less expensive ears. Reconsider, will you? I have enjoyed our fun so far.~
@2573  = ~Hmph! It's right rude of you! I certainly need not suffer this indignity further!~
@2574  = ~Oh no, I'll not be dealing with you again! Insult me will you? Hmph!~
@2575  = ~That's the spirit! A little larceny never hurt anyone! Well, it won't hurt ME anyway. And to be fair, I would prefer if no one else suffered any injury during this exploit. I mean, I want you to steal something, but I want you to do it in as nice a way possible. It's roguery on par with Danilo Thann of Waterdeep, and I'll pay you well. 500 gold for one night's work. It's better than you could hope for in a year on the docks!~
@2576  = ~Straight to the point and as serious as the subject demands. Certainly you are the cream of the larcenous crop. For retrieving but one object, I will give you 500 gold. No killing, and only the one item is to be taken. Dashing banditry just like in the songs of bards!~
@2577  = ~Oh, it's a marvelous trinket! A wondrously curious little toy from distant Lantan. What did they call it...? OH, yes... a "telescope," of all things. It's a misleading name for such an interestingly crafted artifact. "Golden Extra-Farseer" would have suited its craftsmanship so much better. There is not another like it this side of the Trackless Sea! Most gnomes have a fixation of sorts, but I don't share the love of gems that possesses my kin. I prefer the feel of metal, and the intricacies of the mechanical. Not that I necessarily understand the function, but it's not right for such an item to be locked away regardless! It was meant to be used and to be held by loving hands, and if those hands just happen to be mine, more the better. The tele-thingy is on display at the Hall of Wonders, and were it in the possession of anyone else it might be purchasable. No doubt you know that the Hall of Wonders is an extension of the High House, the temple to Gond. Being the god of artifice and invention his followers take to revering mechanical devices, and will not part with an original at any price. It's not as though they make proper use of such things! Keeping them behind locked doors where loving hands cannot explore their subtleties. The tele-whatzit was made to be USED, not worshipped! It must be in the hands of someone who can truly appreciate it! Not to be immodest, but that someone is me! I suppose I might buy a replica, but would you wish a copy of a diamond? It's just not the same.~
@2578  = ~You can stop trying to sell me, I'm interested. Just tell me what the actual job is, and why you are willing to take such a risk.~
@2579  = ~You can stop trying to sell me, I'm interested. Just tell me what the actual job is, and why you are willing to take such a risk.~
@2580  = ~You would be advised to lower your standards before they land you in prison! The Hall of Wonders is nigh invulnerable, a veritable fortress! I'll not risk my good name on such a foolhardy task!~
@2581  = ~That is certainly a difficult task you've set before me, you windy little man, but I will accept the challenge.~
@2582  = ~It's a risky venture, I'll grant you that. Perhaps I can sweeten the prospect a little. I will add a magical item from my personal collection. It will be difficult to part with one of my treasures, but definitely worth it. Will it suffice for you?~
@2583  = ~I'm afraid I simply must draw the line there. To trade TWO of my treasures for ONE would be the height of foolishness. The deal is as I said so, as the saying goes, take it or leave it.~
@2584  = ~Wonderful! Oh, this is SO bad of me! Ahem... Well, I shall leave you to your preparations. It will certainly be a test of your mettle entering the Hall. I imagine an experienced roustabout such as yourself will "case the joint" thoroughly, eh? Get the guards' schedule down and all that? Oh, if only I could be a part of it. It's thrilling, like the songs of legend. I'll meet you back here once the burglary is announced. Hee hee, it's too much fun.~
@2585  = ~Hello again, my roguish compatriot! I heard this morning that there was a mysterious break-in at the Hall of Wonders. It's said that the crafty burglars were in like ghosts and gone before the guard even had a chance to yell halt. Ooh, it's like an adventure tale starring you and me! You are well worth your pay, my friend, well worth it! Here is your 500 gold and a beautiful little trinket from my own personal collection. It's a sorrow to part with it, but this more than makes up. Goodbye and good fortune be on you.~
@2586  = ~Are you mad?! Have you any idea the trouble you've caused?! I told you not to hurt anyone! It's already all over the city, and the guard are looking for blood, they are! It'll be years before I could display that tele-thing in Amn, let alone here! Keep it, our deal is off!~
@2587  = ~Ahhh! Guards! Help! It's the bandits who broke into the Hall of Wonders! They're trying to kill me! And I've never seen them before in my life! Really!~
@2588  = ~I don't care what you do with it, though I wouldn't try to sell it if I were you! Every merchant from here to Cormyr will know it's stolen goods, and most of the fences 'round here probably won't want to touch it either. Maybe if you dump it back on the step of the Hall of Wonders it will cool the ire of the guard. Either way, bury it before it buries you! Oh, I am NOT cut out for this lifestyle.~
@2589  = ~Fine, whatever! Here is your money, here is your magic, there is the door! I never saw you, I've never met you, and I've never even seen anyone that looks like you!~
@2590  = ~I take your meaning well and clear. I shall just have to procure the needed skills elsewhere. It should not be so difficult, perhaps that nice gentleman I bumped into on the way in. Polite as a saint, he was. Must dash... Oh dear. Um... it would appear that I have misplaced my purse. The strings appear to have snapped... How odd. No matter, I shall simply explain my situation to the innkeep and have him extend some friendly credit. I'm certain it will be no trouble. Everyone has been so accommodating thus far.~
@2591  = ~Am I EVER glad to see your face again! It's perhaps the only honest one these walls have ever seen! I've explained my lack of coinage to the innkeep, and he replied with a suggestion involving my father and a sheep! He won't let me leave till I've paid, but his accursed interest has already turned 5 gold into 50! I don't expect a handout, but would you consider buying my ring? I paid 1,000 gold for it not a tenday ago. It's a wonderful stone. An opal. Only 500. Please?~
@2592  = ~So it would seem you are indeed honest, yet cruel as well. An odd combination I'd not have predicted, though I've learned much about people today. I'll thank you to leave me to my misery.~
@2593  = ~Well, I hardly think that I deserve such treatment as this! You can keep your 50 gold, and your holier-than-you-thou attitude! I'll just give the ring itself to the innkeep, and put you out of the deal altogether. Just because you may be right, does not mean you've license to be petty!~
@2594  = ~It's sorely welcomed. Though I suppose it is funny. Oh, but this has been SUCH a bother! It's the price for acting as I did, I guess. I certainly hope I've learned my lesson, by golly! From now on, I'll have someone hire people for me! Goodbye!~
@2595  = ~Speak your mind, sir, so I might know your meaning.~
@2596  = ~Am I to understand that you intend me to do something I would not be proud to speak of?~
@2597  = ~I am not one who can be hired out of a tavern!~
@2598  = ~I've other business! Begone.~
@2599  = ~Illegal, eh? What's in it for me to take such a risk?~
@2600  = ~I'll have none of this, sir! Be thankful I don't turn you over to the guard!~
@2601  = ~I'm listening, though my ears don't hear so good lately. Perhaps I should test them with the rattle o' coins.~
@2602  = ~What's the score, my little friend?~
@2603  = ~Illegal eh? What's in it for me to take such a risk?~
@2604  = ~I'll have none of this, sir! Be thankful I don't turn you over to the guard!~
@2605  = ~I'm listening, though my ears don't hear so good lately. Perhaps I should test them with the rattle o' coins.~
@2606  = ~What's the score, my little friend?~
@2607  = ~Illegal, eh? What's in it for me to take such a risk?~
@2608  = ~I'll none of this, sir! Be thankful I don't turn you over to the guard!~
@2609  = ~What's the score, my little friend?~
@2610  = ~Oh dear! I couldn't hear a word you said, though if I had, I would have answered "more."~
@2611  = ~Illegal, eh? What's in it for me to take such a risk?~
@2612  = ~I'll none of this, sir! Be thankful I don't turn you over to the guard!~
@2613  = ~What's the score, my little friend?~
@2614  = ~Nope, I still can't hear a word you're saying. Pity that. Although...~
@2615  = ~Illegal, eh? What's in it for me to take such a risk?~
@2616  = ~I'll none of this, sir! Be thankful I don't turn you over to the guard!~
@2617  = ~What's the score, my little friend?~
@2618  = ~What?! What?! Did someone say something?! I think it was "goodbye!"~
@2619  = ~Ouch. It's truly a fraction of what it be worth, but I've little choice. Still, expensive lessons are learned doubly well.~
@2620  = ~500 gold for all that, eh? This is not a bad offer, though I think you could do better.~
@2621  = ~You would be advised to lower your standards before they land you in prison! The Hall of Wonders is nigh invulnerable, a veritable fortress! I'll not risk my good name on such a foolhardy task!~
@2622  = ~It is certainly a difficult task you've set before me, you windy little man, but I will accept the challenge.~
@2623  = ~It is a start, though not nearly sweet enough to take the bitterness from MY mouth. What else have ye?~
@2624  = ~It is not worth my time, little friend. Go bother someone else.~
@2625  = ~I've no wish to be famous from a jail cell! Take your offer and begone!~
@2626  = ~I've no wish to be famous from a jail cell! Take your offer and begone!~
@2627  = ~You would be advised to lower your standards before they land you in prison! The Hall of Wonders is nigh invulnerable, a veritable fortress! I'll not risk my good name on such a foolhardy task!~
@2628  = ~That is certainly a difficult task you've set before me, you windy little man, but I will accept the challenge.~
@2629  = ~Hold on just a moment there! I went through quite the bother getting this thing, and you ARE going to pay for it!~
@2630  = ~But what will I do with it? I never wanted the thing!~
@2631  = ~No one breaks a deal with me and lives! Have at thee!~
@2632  = ~Bwaa ha ha ha! Serves you right for scheming as you did! It's your bed to lie in, and I'll have none of it!~
@2633  = ~Ha ha HA! The joke of it is worth as much! Aye, take your 500 gold, and mind what happened here when you next look to someone else's property!~
@2634  = ~Oh, I've really no need for such an item... at that price. What say I give you... 200 gold. Under the circumstances, I'd advise you to take it!~
@2635  = ~Oh, I see! My honesty is only appropriate when it suits you! Well, I'll not have it! I'll give you the 50 gold you need and not a copper more! That'll learn ya!~
@2636  = ~Greetings to you and yours, my friend. Might I have your ear a moment?~
@2637  = ~Certainly, good sir. What is your concern?~
@2638  = ~I'm in no mood for idle chatter. Leave me be.~
@2639  = ~Say your piece and move along. My time is valuable.~
@2640  = ~As you wish. I'll trouble you no more.~
@2641  = ~Changed your mind, have you? The offer be good till I find someone.~
@2642  = ~I've a been watching you, but rest assured it no be in the bad evil eye way. You and your compatriots be so obviously... Well, I just say you no look like farmers or merchants. I've a service needing completion, and it require that which I think you have. I reward well, but the mission is dangerous and beyond what the law would technically allow. Interested, yes?~
@2643  = ~My position has not changed. It's a risk I do not wish to take.~
@2644  = ~I've no desire to sully my good name in this town by crossing the law! Take your offer and leave!~
@2645  = ~What is it I will be expected to do?~
@2646  = ~What is it I will be expected to do?~
@2647  = ~Why not do this yourself? You do not seem as powerless as your plea makes you sound.~
@2648  = ~Your terms are acceptable. I agree.~
@2649  = ~You are mercenary, no? I can tell because you are battle-ugly with scars, yes? I have need of a stealthy, well-equipped group, to perform an act the guard would frown upon. I trust you are available and willing? I pay better than common blade-wage, but you need be discreet. I go on, yes?~
@2650  = ~I would perhaps look to a mercenary guild for more professional help, but my time is limited, and you will have to do. I pay more than you're worth, so you listen well, no?~
@2651  = ~My proposition is thus: I would have you enter into the home of a colleague of mine and effect the release of a creature he has imprisoned there. Ragefast be his name, and he has in his possession one of the most beautiful and useful creatures in all of Faerun. It's a nymph he captured some time ago, and I know not what laughable plans he has for her, but I am sure she be more... productive in my care. I not so rich as to be able to offer huge gold, but as competent wizard I do have the odd magical item of worth. Perhaps an enchanted item will serve your needs, no?~
@2652  = ~Your offer is interesting, but I would prefer if it were larger. It is quite the risk you wish me to take.~
@2653  = ~Indeed, I be proficient in that which is magical, but so is Ragefast. None know better how to defend against a wizard than another wizard. This require stealth and guile, or quick blade with muscle behind. You have; I lack. Simple, no?~
@2654  = ~Would that I did have magical items strewn about the place. Were it so, I could simply sell them and pay you gold. It is not as though they are cheap to come by. As it is, you must take the offer as is or not at all. I trust you understand, no?~
@2655  = ~Most agreeable! Already you show intelligence needed to succeed! I give you directions to Ragefast's abode, and you take it from there, yes? You will find Ragefast's home northeast of the Hall of Wonders. We meet at my home when you complete your mission. Do not tarry, for I have many plans. Let not the guard see you with the nymph. They will surely question her presence. I will expect you soon.~
@2656  = ~Enter and climb, I meet you at top, yes?~
@2657  = ~I see that you have returned, yes? You need not say that you have betrayed me, for I scry and spy! Certainly you are foolish to have come here after breaking our deal! I have many spells waiting for parts of nymph, and will be a long time looking for another. An expensive delay you have cost me, and compensation be from your hide! Come get me at the top, if you dare!~
@2658  = ~Come little fly, the spider's larder you must flee!~
@2659  = ~A profitable day for both our interests! A service of immense proportions you have served me!~
@2660  = ~No, child, you need not worry your pretty little head. In but a tenday, you will no longer be here, or anywhere. I would have a word with your "liberators" a moment. Wait there, please.~
@2661  = ~A job done well in every respect, and no finer a specimen could I have wished for. By far, she is the most elusive spell component I have ever had to seek. Her body will yield a score of human control potions, as well as at least two or three items of "command"! I am assured wealth for this season and next at the very least, and I have you to thank. You please have this item and enjoy, yes. It is a good thing you do here today. Show yourselves out, I have much work to attend to.~
@2662  = ~Why have you remained in my home?! Have I not paid as we agreed? I must have solitude, so I ask you again and you go, yes?~
@2663  = ~Oh, you have named it! How cute. No longer useful you are, and I'll not suffer your pining for your pet! Intruders in my home! Deadly self-defense! Come battle me at the top, if you dare!~
@2664  = ~Her beauty is priceless in the eyes, but bottled and powdered it is gold in my coffer!~
@2665  = ~She is a resource to be tapped! If you would stand before me, it is you who will be stopped! The guard will see your charred and dead bodies as bandits in my home! Come find me at the top, if you dare!~
@2666  = ~I've no desire to sully my good name in this town by crossing the law! Take your offer and leave!~
@2667  = ~What is it I will be expected to do?~

@2683  = ~Look unto me, Ragefast. My beauty fades even now.~
@2684  = ~'Tis flattering, but you are blinded by your passion. Truly see what is become of me. I should not age, but my spirit fades in this ugly place. Yours does as well, but from obsession over me.~
@2685  = ~In my glade amidst the stars and moon. 'Twas beauty in that, but I cannot be confined with thee. I am not human, and this is not my home.~
@2686  = ~I am not without fault, but 'tis my nature to breed obsession in people. A hazard of just being who and what I am. As for my impromptu saviors, my gratitude is boundless! Please, take a lock of hair to remember me by. I doubt I shall seek the company of man for some time. Goodbye.~
@2687  = ~My poor Ragefast. Like many humans he could not understand the feelings my kind elicits. What of you, savior? I should like to believe I am free, but your kind often does good things for bad reasons. What are your plans for me?~
@2688  = ~You are free by my hand, and none shall cage you again.~
@2689  = ~I have a duty to complete, regardless of how I feel. You are to be delivered to Ramazith, but I don't imagine his treatment of you could be worse than Ragefast's.~
@2690  = ~It will be good to feel the grass beneath my feet once more. If you would just release this restraining collar, I will regain a measure of my talents. I thought it only ornamental when he gave it to me. Please, will you help me?~
@2691  = ~My gratitude is boundless! Please, take a lock of my hair to remember me by. I doubt I shall seek the company of man for some time. Goodbye.~
@2692  = ~Ramazith?! Ragefast was deathly afraid I should fall into his hands. He would not say why, but it worries me nonetheless. I beg of you, do not do this!~
@2693  = ~These are mere words. Ramazith shall have thee, as the deal we struck decrees.~
@2694  = ~I fear I am to die in this ugly town. Drag me on, for I care not.~
@2695  = ~I am to be a captive here now? I shall die amidst this ugliness!~
@2696  = ~Well! Have you any more mad friends to pass me on to, or shall I just kill myself now to save time for everyone?~
@2697  = ~My sincerest apologies! Had I but known his plan I would have released you before!~
@2698  = ~Perhaps Ramazith had a good idea! Mayhaps your body can get me the money he spoke of! Hello, time to die!~
@2699  = ~You are an absolute monster!~
@2700  = ~Spare me your repentance and just remove this restraining collar. I shall accept no more gifts or assistance from human kind for some time, to be sure!~
@2701  = ~Now know thee well I cannot let thee leave. We are meant to be together, whether ye know it or no.~
@2702  = ~What?! What bandit dares enter the home of Ragefast?! Identify your purpose here, that I might know what to put on thy tombstone!~

@2716  = ~Your twisted feelings cloud your sight! Release her, before you both come to harm!~
@2717  = ~My feelings are genuine, and none shall harm the angelic Abela! I will let no one come between us!~
@2718  = ~She will learn to be happy here! We shall grow old together.~
@2719  = ~Abela, thy beauty is as brilliant now as the day I found you. Say not such things.~
@2720  = ~But we were meant for each other! Thy very words had said so!~
@2721  = ~But this is MY home...~
@2722  = ~She will die in your "care." Ramazith is right to want her release.~
@2723  = ~Whine if you wish, but tonight she is free! Stand in the way and you perish with your foolish dreams.~
@2724  = ~This Abela will die with you. Free her if you truly feel as you do.~
@2725  = ~My innermost thoughts are displayed before you, and I must suffer your mockery? Trifle with me no longer!~
@2726  = ~I would sooner we both died here, than lose her beauty in my life! You will pay for this pain, stranger! 'Twas not your place to meddle with me!~
@2727  = ~I... It is so. Forgive me, Abela, I have been a fool. I release you from my enchantments, and you are free to leave. Please do not think too harshly of me. I am but a foolish old man.~
@2728  = ~I know not why you have turned on me, but your life is forfeit for it!~
@2729  = ~Dare you speak of me as bandit, when you commit such crimes as you do?!~
@2730  = ~This Abela will die with you. Free her if you truly feel as you do.~

@2737  = ~Your intentions are diabolical! Release Abela at once, or face my wrath!~
@2738  = ~You must realize that this is an abomination worse than keeping her caged! Do not do this!~
@2739  = ~By all the gods! What kind of fiend are thee to have murdered as harmless a creature as a nymph?! You'll find no assistance here, you mongrel! Even ogres would not kill such a being! Get out before I have your black heart ripped from your chest!~
@2740  = ~Well, well! If I'm not mistaken, that be a lock of nymph's hair. A luckier being there cannot be than they who have gained the favor of such a creature. Would ye be willing to part with a small portion of that sample? I could pay, say, 500 gold for it.~
@2741  = ~A generous offer, and I accept it.~
@2742  = ~Oh, I couldn't sell this. It was a gift. Not unless you offered me outrageous amounts of money.~
@2743  = ~You'll not touch a hair of it! It's mine and mine alone!~
@2744  = ~There is simply no way someone with your manner could have come by that hair honorably! Get out of my sight, I'll no serve ye here!~
@2745  = ~Suit yourself, though I can't say as I blame ya. Very useful stuff, that. Say, how about I have a seamstress weave it within a cloak for ye? It is said that the wearer of such an item is magically more beautiful. It would not cost much, perhaps 100 gold. Delicate stuff, it is.~
@2746  = ~I'm content with it the way it is, thank you.~
@2747  = ~I'll not have strangers put a finger on it! It is mine to keep.~
@2748  = ~An excellent suggestion! You have a deal!~
@2749  = ~It will be ready for you in but three days. Return then and you shall have your prize.~
@2750  = ~Welcome back, It's ready as I promised. Beautiful, is it not? You'll be the toast of the town in this.~
@2751  = ~I'm afraid your garment is not ready yet. Return when we agreed, and you shall have it.~
@2752  = ~As you will, but it does you little good in your pocket. The offer stands if you return here.~
@2753  = ~Back again with that wondrous hair, I see. Have you reconsidered my offer?~
@2754  = ~Wonderful! The things that can be done with nymph hair are amazing! In fact, since you are so generous with it, why don't I weave what you have left within a tunic? It's said such a garment enhances the beauty of the wearer. No charge for you, friend.~
@2755  = ~An offer I could not refuse!~
@2756  = ~I would just as soon keep it as it is. Thanks anyway.~

@2760  = ~An excellent suggestion! You have a deal!~
@2761  = ~'Ere, stop a moment. I've got a word or two ye need to hear.~
@2762  = ~Aye, you're a fine group o' mercenaries are you? Leastwise that's the word on the street, that you do the odd job here n' there? I've a boss who'd like to have a word wit' you if you can spare the time. He don't ask fer free though, and here be 50 gold just to hear him out.~
@2763  = ~Move along, stranger. I've no time to dawdle with you.~
@2764  = ~50 gold just to listen? A fair deal, lead on.~
@2765  = ~50 gold may get one ear, but I've another to support as well.~
@2766  = ~The gold be a gift o' my employer. Do you not think it right rude to ask fer more without even speaking to him? No more from me, so follow or don't.~
@2767  = ~Disappointing. I'll leave you to your quiet little stroll then.~
@2768  = ~Best be keeping a low profile about yourself, you tardy fool. Weren't no small insult to my boss, you taking that 50 gold and then missin' the meeting. Not a good career move to earn the ire o' the master of the Thieves' Guild. I'd be advising you to stay clear any dark corners.~
@2769  = ~'Ere be my intrepid layabouts again. Have ye time enough fer a visit now, or did I pay you 50 gold to be ignored?~
@2770  = ~My apologies for keeping you waiting. Lead on.~
@2771  = ~I've no more interest in you now than before. Take your 50 gold back and leave me be.~
@2772  = ~Your 50 gold did indeed hire my ear, but only for a moment. Begone, lest I throw in a fist free of charge.~
@2773  = ~You're a right confusing individual, the way you invite trouble. Rest assured, you'll be hearing about this again. A friendly warning: Stay out o' dark alleys.~
@2774  = ~I'll take the gold back, but it don't mean much. Not having the courtesy to even meet with my employer is an insult he'll not soon forget. He didn't become master o' the Thieves' Guild by suffering ignorance from the likes of you.~
@2775  = ~A wise choice o' action. Now just follow me, an' I'll show ya the way ta the guild. If ye're asked the password, it's "Fafhrd." When ye're in the guild, just look fer the man named Alatos "Ravenscar" Thuibuld.~
@2776  = ~Wrong answer. Git outta here 'fore ya get hurt. I might not be able to stop a buncha well-armed adventurers, but if you cause any trouble in the guild, don't be expecting to walk out in one piece.~
@2777  = ~That's right, pal. Ya all can go in now.~
@2778  = ~Follow me closely inside as well. I fancy there no be a more dangerous a building in all o' Baldur's Gate. Can you think o' anywhere better equipped against thieves than the Thieves' Guild itself? Could teach Durlag's Tower a thing or three, I dare say.~
@2779  = ~Listen carefully! If we ever become separated, it is imperative that you make your way to the Friendly Arm Inn. There you will meet Khalid and Jaheira. They have long been my friends, and you can trust them.~
@2780  = ~50 gold just to listen? A fair deal. Lead on.~
@2781  = ~Move along, stranger. I've no time to dawdle with you.~
@2782  = ~I'll follow, I'll follow. No need to get snippy.~
@2783  = ~Welcome, my little friends! Please relax, and keep your weapons at your sides. No need for hostility.~
@2784  = ~I simply must apologize for the manner of my thieves. I suppose a thieves' guild must keep a measure of malice about it, but it does tend to put a cloud over introductions. I am Alatos Thuibuld, though I thank you not to mention that too often. You are <CHARNAME>, of course. Be not surprised, there are very few people in Baldur's Gate I cannot name. You have been here for only a few days, and have already made quite a stir.~
@2785  = ~Do you have something to tell me, or am I here just to listen to your fat musings?~
@2786  = ~Your interest in me is flattering, though I question your intent.~
@2787  = ~This is quite the honor, having one such as yourself interested in my travels.~
@2788  = ~Ho HO! Such fire untempered by common sense! An unfortunately common cause of early demise in my organization. Now, because I like you, I'll show you what waits for your next outburst. You have the rare opportunity to revise your statement, and your life expectancy.~
@2789  = ~Your lackeys don't scare me one whit, you pompous windbag!~
@2790  = ~Your interest in me is flattering, though I question your intent.~
@2791  = ~It is quite the honor, having one such as yourself interested in my travels.~
@2792  = ~Hmph. Well, I suppose I should thank you for showing your true nature right away. It saves me the time I'd have spent evaluating you. No need for it now, and no need to ask if you'll take the job. I'll not have you work for me, and you know too much to leave, so I'll just have you killed now. I wish I could say it's been nice. Goodbye.~
@2793  = ~Oh, please, save your ingratiating remarks for another time. They are far too good to be wasted on me. In truth, you have never heard of me, and I care not a whit where you go from here. While in this city however, you become my concern. In fact, I should like to take advantage of your talents for a small job, something best accomplished by someone unknown in this city.~
@2794  = ~I am quite sure that the membership of a thieves' guild would include several people capable of whatever you ask. Danger of being recognized seems a minor concern if one is able to not be seen at all. Why do you need me?~
@2795  = ~I am not interested in your organization, or in working for it. Sorry, but you'll have to look elsewhere.~
@2796  = ~What exactly is it you would have me do? And what would be my reward for this service? How well can you afford to pay?~
@2797  = ~Mulahey~
@2798  = ~Oh, I don't intend to flatter, merely to assure you that you have been watched since you entered the city. As for my intent, I do have a proposition for your group to consider. A small task really, best suited to someone unknown here.~
@2799  = ~I am quite sure that the membership of a thieves' guild would include several people capable of whatever you ask. Danger of being recognized seems a minor concern if one is able to not be seen at all. Why do you need me?~

@2802  = ~Press ESC to Abort~
@2803  = ~Have I been called here for a reason, or just to listen to your fat musings?~
@2804  = ~Shrewd, very shrewd. I do indeed have many fine individuals of exceptional skill, but a large number of them are vacationing at the garrison this season. The guard have been exceptionally vigilant, what with the banditry on the roads, and to their credit they have captured several of my best people. I am sure that in the history of guilds, we are the first to experience a shortage of thieves.~
@2805  = ~You've gone rather far afield, haven't you, servant? Well, no matter. Anyone to alleviate the boredom is appreciated, even if they are of the lower class.~
@2806  = ~I'm afraid it is not that simple, though it never is, is it? You see, you have been allowed into the inner chambers of my guild, you have met me, and you have seen a number of other members. While this knowledge might not directly benefit you, if made known to the guard it would certainly harm me. I submit to you that I cannot allow this information to leave with someone... not of good standing with the guild. Your choice is somewhat limited in this manner. Choose wisely.~
@2807  = ~I am not interested in your organization, or in working for it. Sorry, but you'll have to look elsewhere.~

@2810  = ~Unfortunate. I must apologize, but I cannot let you leave with knowledge of me and the guild. Security is paramount, and your lives are the unfortunate price.~
@2811  = ~It's quite the bit of intrigue actually. A local wizard by the name of Shandalar makes his home in a moored Halruaan skyship. It would appear that he has the knowledge to reproduce these flying marvels and is currently organizing the sale of the recipe to Grand Duchess Liia Jannath. He has drawn up a set of rituals and has procured an artifact fragment and an ancient statuette vital to the spell that keeps the ships aloft. These he has divided amongst his daughters until the deal is to proceed. I have been contacted by a representative of the Halruaans, and they have no wish to see scores of flying ships manufactured in every port. You are to infiltrate the place of exchange, steal the ingredients, and return here with them. Simple enough. You would be well paid. Enough gold to give you a backache and, if I am well pleased, mayhaps a magical weapon or two. Perhaps a little more, perhaps a little less. It entirely depends upon your performance.~
@2812  = ~As it should be! Now that you have agreed, the facilities of the guild are at your disposal. Feel free to make use of them, and make your presence known to the other members. You have my permission, so they will be less likely to kill you on sight. As for your mission, you have a tenday to complete it. Informants have told me that the Duchess intends to take possession of the components that tenth day, and the exchange will be hosted by Oberon at his estate. As I see it, you have several options. Directly "persuade" any of the involved parties to hand over the items, or burgle them out from under their noses. Good luck.~
@2813  = ~You did not complete the mission. Disappointing, to say the least. I am afraid that I don't take too kind a view of failure, and even less so when it means trouble for me as well. I should like you to meet Resar, my Halruaan contact. Not very pleased with any of us, though I have assured him that it is entirely your fault. I believe he would like to have a word with you.~
@2814  = ~A fine, if rough-hewn performance. Of course, while I may not mourn the loss of those you killed, the guard is certainly irate. This is my Halruaan contact, Resar. I believe he would like a word with you about the unnecessary attention you have brought to his cause.~
@2815  = ~Well done, if I do say so myself! A fine bit of burglary with no unnecessary attention brought to yourself. This is Resar, my Halruaan contact. He is well pleased and will now see to your reward. My apologies, but it was part of the agreement.~
@2816  = ~You have returned only half-victorious, which also means half a failure. I should like you to meet my Halruaan contact Resar, who is only half-pleased with your performance.~
@2817  = ~Narlen! What, by all the gods, are you doing?!~
@2818  = ~Explain yourself, lest you take an earth bath by next morn!~
@2819  = ~Seems ye made quite the impression on the guild, ye did. It would also seem that I erred aligning with Resar. Blasted politics addles the brains, and time and again I should stay out! Still, we've his coin, and the story of his demise is ours to construct. Never a total loss to be had! Ye have earned a place in the guild, a tie that never breaks.~
@2820  = ~Hello there.~
@2821  = ~I am not interested in your organization or in working for it. Sorry, but you'll have to look elsewhere.~
@2822  = ~I am not interested in your organization or in working for it. Sorry, but you'll have to look elsewhere.~

@2825  = ~What exactly is it you would have me do? And what would be my reward for this service? How well can you afford to pay?~
@2826  = ~Rock and a hard place, how well I know thee. Nevertheless, I still wish nothing to do with you or your blasted Thieves' Guild.~
@2827  = ~Seems a fairly straightforward bit of burglary and well within my ability. I accept this challenge and hope it increases my standing within the guild.~
@2828  = ~Not good enough. I wish a set price, with half the coin in my purse beforehand. I'll not be uncertain about what awaits when the task is through.~
@2829  = ~I am sorry, but I have no wish to make enemies of a family of mages. Find someone else to do your task.~
@2830  = ~I see. Well, having carefully considered your terms, I have decided that you are in no position to speak to me in such a manner. My offer is more than generous, and ye could not hope to do better unless ye burgled the Ducal Palace itself. You have but a yes or no to choose from.~
@2831  = ~I am sorry, but I have no wish to make enemies of a family of mages. Find someone else to do your task.~

@2835  = ~Seems a fairly straightforward bit of burglary and well within my ability. I accept this challenge and hope it increases my standing within the guild.~
@2836  = ~It was you who asked me here and you who should be prepared to pay. I will do nothing for you without gold in my purse!~
@2837  = ~A very expensive setback you have cost us! Your incompetence means counterfeit ships in ports by year's end! A more profound dishonor to the brilliant craftsmen of my land I cannot imagine! Protests from our statesmen will be launched, and your local governor will be made to see our point of view. In the between, all record of this furtive attempt will be erased. Apologies, but this includes you!~
@2838  = ~The recovery of our secret is most welcome, but the scrutiny your actions bring will do much damage. I must erase all knowledge of this plan by removing all expendable people. This unfortunately means you. Apologies, but you must die!~
@2839  = ~Alatos was most assuring in his description of your abilities. Right he was, and it is unfortunate I must close all loose ends. This includes potential loose tongues, and, though talented, you are also expendable. I offer my sorrows, but you must die!~
@2840  = ~This was risky venture from the start, and though you have undoubtedly slowed ship building, they will now be on guard. Further thievery is impossible, so now to expensive diplomacy. All record of this attempt must be destroyed, including all those expendable. My sorrow to your family, but you must die!~
@2841  = ~Wha... GURK!~
@2842  = ~It will be the darkest day ye have never seen before I don't have what ye need. Fer the right price, anyway.~
@2843  = ~What will ye need today? Remember, cash or hit the bricks. I extend no credit, especially to new recruits.~
@2844  = ~Off wit' ye now. I've counting to do.~
@2845  = ~Alarm! Alarm! Snakes in our own guild! Take 'em alive so we can kill 'em slow!~
@2846  = ~diviner~
@2847  = ~Yes? Is there something I could be of assistance with?~
@2848  = ~I'm a touch busy at the moment. Was there something you needed?~
@2849  = ~This had better be important indeed. I've no time for handouts today, today of all days.~
@2850  = ~I am ever so sorry, but we are not accustomed to our servants being... so well armed. You'll just not do.~
@2851  = ~Nothing has changed since your last visit. Kindly stop distracting me from my work.~
@2852  = ~The position? Ahhh yes, we are indeed looking for a servant to help clean. It is ever so large an estate, and she does tend to get away on you if you're not careful. Have you any experience in such an expansive building?~
@2853  = ~I've not the time for this. Pardon my rudeness, but goodbye.~
@2854  = ~Oh? Which palace would that be then?~
@2855  = ~Well, THIS be Oberon's ESTATE, his one and only abode, and you have never been here before. To be sure, lying will not net you a job here. Off with you!~
@2856  = ~Is it so? Well, Grand Duchess Liia is within these walls and has said openly that she never lets a servant go without good reason. If she'll not have you, we'll not either.~
@2857  = ~Oh, it's sorrily a shame. Oberon has never liked Piergeiron Paladinstar and certainly won't suffer a servant not good enough for him to keep. I must turn you away.~
@2858  = ~Oh, dear me! Never mention that to master Oberon. He has never liked Piergeiron Paladinstar and won't have a servant not good enough for him. I should not do this, but I need the extra help, so consider yourself hired. We've important guests at the moment, so you had best stay in the background. Clean the rooms in the east wing, and leave the west for me.~
@2859  = ~Oh, no no no. I should need someone with more credentials. Important guests this week, and I can't risk their comfort. My apologies, but I cannot take you on.~
@2860  = ~Well, I would have wished for someone with a touch more credentials, but I am run right ragged without help. You're hired, but watch your step. We've important guests at the moment, so you had best stay in the background. Clean the rooms in the east wing, and leave the west for me.~

Gold to split but three sides, 'tween me, Rededge here, and you. 'Tis a right simple bit o' skullduggery this first night, and we but need yer nighteye to spy the lane. Up fer the task?~

@2900  = ~Now we're up to the business! Keep to the shadows and the watch will be blind to our sneak. You will spy the road while Rededge an' I plunder within. Be on yer cautions and yell the warnin' if ye see the soldierman. I'd no fight 'em if I was you, just call the call and make for the dark. If they give chase, ye fade to black an' keep quiet.

The city'll be pins n' needles for a week, long after the window closes on the score for tonight! We scored 300 gold this last, and that's all I'll get with you! Take it n' go, ye Captain Hackum!~
@2902  = ~Ye would show yer jack nasty face back here after runnin' out on us?! Ye didn'a call the warn, ye gacking mather!

@2969  = ~Invisibility (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or his gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, until the wizard's location is given away by manipulating objects or initiating dialogue, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus the invisible being can move, open doors, talk if spoken to first, climb stairs, or drop items while remaining invisible. However, if the invisible being picks up objects, initiates dialogue or attacks, the invisibility is broken, although the invisibility enables a surprise attack.~

@3106  = ~Get lost, you rummy alley-rat. I've no time for you.~
@3107  = ~What of the Thieves' Guild? Could you not remain there?~
@3108  = ~It can't be as bad as everyone says. Thanks for the chat but I'll have to check it out myself.~
@3109  = ~It's rough going on the streets these days. Used to be that a few gold would turn a guard's eye, but the Flaming Fist have put a good number of me fellows in the pokey lately. I figures they are still a touch angered by the death of that Scar fellow. His replacement Angelo seems is a bit more... driven. If ye wish to keep to the streets, ye had best be a better sneaksman than I.~
@3110  = ~There be no call for that at all! If'n we weren't in the Sanctuary, you'd be a stain on me blade! Take yer words back!~
@3111  = ~The guild be all but gone. It's not just the thievery that suffers neither. The Fist seem to wish a lock on every person with skill in the magic or the blade. The average Joe Regular has never known such peace, but it is a horrible constraint on all else. Adventurers usually about have taken to the countryside, or places like this, rather than lose their arms.~
@3112  = ~Right, I'll do you for that! Just... not here. But just you wait! Ooo, you're gonna get it!~
@3113  = ~Ah, your mother wore crampons.~
@3114  = ~I fear the problems of the day have addled my nerves. Forgive my outburst.~

@3131  = ~Ah, you would be Ajantis, I presume. I trust your journey was uneventful? My brethren and I are grateful you have come, though it is regretful that you are needed. The keep is usually closed to outsiders, but circumstances do demand extraordinary measures in this case. No doubt Duke Eltan told you of the problem? Eight people have gone missing from the grounds, three of those in the last two days alone. Isolated as we are, we have not the means to deal with this. Please, do what you can.~
@3132  = ~Have you no security here? The keep cannot be without defenses of SOME kind. I must speak with the captain of the guard.~
@3133  = ~What is your station here? I don't even know your name.~
@3134  = ~Alas, normally we DO have a substantial number of guards. The majority have been sent east however, to help combat the rash of robberies along the Coastway road. It was after that our own problems began. Two of our remaining guards are among the missing, and Captain himself has not been seen since yesterday last. We have appointed a replacement in his stead, and you may find him about the grounds.~
@3135  = ~Forgive my manners, I have not introduced myself! I am Satos, and unfortunately I am the acting abbot. It is not that I don't find honor in the position, quite the contrary. It is just unfortunate how I came by it. Our true Elder Abbot was among the first to disappear.~

@3147  = ~This information is appreciated, and I shall do what I can. It is quite a task to complete on my own, however.~
@3148  = ~Oh! I had meant to tell you but it slipped my mind. I fear I have been somewhat scatterbrained since this has begun. Duke Eltan anticipated your need for a little assistance, so he arranged for a mercenary guild to send along some hired help. A strange mix, to be sure, but I am certain they will serve with you well. All seem quite skilled in their... uh... niches. Introductions are in order, I believe.~
@3149  = ~Um... yes, well... Next?~
@3150  = ~Yes, well, now that that is taken care of I shall leave you to the task at hand. You have leave to wander where you will, and all but the main keep are open to you. That one building must be kept sealed regardless, for the sake of the many treasured tomes within. It's not as though we mistrust YOU, rather 'tis just better to have as little traffic as possible through. I hope you understand. Forgive me, but I have meditations to attend to.~

@3164  = ~Grateful? Grateful that strangers must invade my home because my missing fellows are gone, perhaps dead? No, I shall be grateful when you leave. Begone and do what you must.~
@3165  = ~Hmm... I fear I read your manner wrong and I apologize, though I still dislike strangers traipsing about mine home. Your efforts be appreciated, but I shall still be glad when you are done.~

@3173  = ~I... see. I fail to see how this kind of "help" is useful. What is your purpose here if we could have just loosed a rabid bear and got the same effect? Tonight I shall sleep no better.~

@3183  = ~By Ilmater, please, send him home. I know... knew them all, though I knew... a great deal more about one of them. We were... we... Montgomery and I were... I cannot speak of this! To think of losing him... 'Tis not fair, you know. We fought the other night and he left so mad. Such unions are... frowned upon by our order, but now he's gone and I... Please find him. Find all of them, and bring them home safe.~
@3184  = ~I know not. I only know they are sorely missed... by most if not all.~
@3185  = ~I... I should not have said that. It's unfair to think ill of another with no proof. It's just that... Well, some seem to have had much to gain in this loss.~
@3186  = ~Please! These people were closer than family! How could you accuse me so?~
@3187  = ~This is all so painful. I must do something besides sit idly by. Please, might I join with thee? I need to know what has happened to my... to all my friends.~

@3210  = ~It's dangerous to go against your Captain so.~
@3211  = ~Good to know, though I doubt I shall be much help with him around.~
@3212  = ~I trust none of the guard while he commands you. Leave me be.~
@3213  = ~Eldoth is NOT my captain. MY captain is a noble man who never would have let this go so long without requesting aid. Eldoth has but made the problem worse. I will deny I said this if you tell another soul. I must go.~
@3214  = ~I blame you not at all. It is as though he be TRYING to isolate us. I wonder if it's possible the disappearances have weakened his sanity. Alas, it is not for me to say. I have said too much already. I must go.~
@3215  = ~Doubtful ANY of us will be of help while he commands. I can speak with you no longer, lest he see us together. Fare thee well.~
@3216  = ~What are you doing here! This is the Amnian military barracks. Unless you have a very good reason for being here, it would be prudent for you to leave.~
@3217  = ~We don't need any new recruits. Now leave!~
@3218  = ~You've had your look. Now get out!~
@3219  = ~Ahhh, sorry, we'll be leaving now.~
@3220  = ~We're here to join the Amnian army.~
@3221  = ~We just wanted to have a look around.~
@3222  = ~Get out now, or we'll take you out by force if need be.~
@3223  = ~A welcome release. Your weakling surface ways have left a bitter taste in my mouth. Perhaps I should seek shelter back under the cover of the earth. I understood my fellows there.~
@3224  = ~Deagan~
@3225  = ~'Ere there... pssssst. This way. I've got a word or two for you, but when I'm done talkin' I never said a word, understand?~
@3226  = ~I have no time for secret meetings, fool. Begone with your games.~
@3227  = ~Speak that I might know your intent.~
@3228  = ~What is your purpose here at the keep?~
@3229  = ~Pique I am, and I am a member of the guard. At least I was when there was a guard to speak of. The new captain has made it otherwise.~
@3230  = ~Slander of your superiors is no trait of a guard! I trust you not!~
@3231  = ~I have no time for secret meetings, fool. Begone with your games.~
@3232  = ~Speak! That I might know your intent.~
@3233  = ~If Eldoth bears the traits of a guard, you are lucky to be alive to mistrust me! Bah! It was a mistake to speak with you! I am done with all of this!~
@3234  = ~I ain't no monk who takes a kick and then turns the other cheek to take another! You no want my help, then so be it! Do yourself a favor though, and search well again the quarters of Eldoth. I go now and hope never to again lay eyes upon this accursed place.~
@3235  = ~My intent be to get out of this place alive. Guard duties or no, the pay be not near enough for dying. I know who be taking the missing people. I seen 'im! It was Eldoth!~
@3236  = ~Eldoth had much to gain with the disappearance of the captain, but this is hardly a reason for such crimes.~
@3237  = ~And why should I believe you? You said nothing till now! Perhaps you just wish me to remove Eldoth so you can captain the guard!~
@3238  = ~Then he will be dead before the morning! With righteous fury we shall smite him down!~
@3239  = ~Are you mad? Does captain of the guard seem such a glorious position to you? One worth murder and kidnapping? Use some sense! There is more here than you see! Feh! I have not time to spell things out to you! Fling your accusations where you will, but watch your back. I am gone, and I leave you to whatever fate you make. Hmph! I will at least save my OWN life.~
@3240  = ~Eh, so that's yer plan then? There's more to this story I fear, and your blade may have to work a fair bit harder than you think. By all means, throw yourself at him, but watch carefully what is BEHIND his actions. I leave you to your... glorious bloodbath. -sniff-~
@3241  = ~Aye, this is what I thought too! Once the main garrison returns from the Coast Way, they would simply replace him as captain. There is more to it, something stranger. I saw him when last dark fell, when he dragged off the monk Montgomery. It was a masterful ambush when night was darkest, and I thought myself lucky to have discovered him. A single snapped twig gave away his position, and I followed slow, ready to leap to rescue. I stopped meself short though, when he turned and looked RIGHT AT ME! He knew my every move, as though he PLANNED for me to see him! His face showed no such cunning at that moment though. Blank he was, blank as the night around us. I had not the nerve to approach, and his eyes seemed to show sadness when I did not move, though his face remained stone cold. He walked away slowly, almost haltingly, while I sat there shivering. Here, take this. He dropped it, and I know not what it means. I am done with this place. There is something most unnatural here, and I want no part of it. Fare you well.~
@3242  = ~Oh, I's not gonna be no helps fer you. I just sits wit' me pretties and watch 'em sparkles.~
@3243  = ~Um... what do you know of the missing people?~
@3244  = ~Where were you when the last person disappeared?~
@3245  = ~Thanks for your... uh... help. Goodbye.~
@3246  = ~I knows dat my pretties shore do sparkle. Got dem from me friends. Friends, dey go bye-bye an' not been back. I sad, but sparkle makes for happy.~
@3247  = ~OH! I remembers! 'Twas dark it was, and the star pointies shone in my pretties. Friends here one night, and go 'way the next. Other friend takes dem away.~
@3248  = ~I not like this sad talk. I go sit wit' my pretties.~
@3249  = ~Other friend? What other friend?~
@3250  = ~Thanks for your... uh... help. Goodbye.~
@3251  = ~Um... what do you know of the missing people?~
@3252  = ~Thanks for your... uh... help. Goodbye.~
@3253  = ~Where were you when the last person disappeared?~
@3254  = ~Can I be helpin' you? I'll say what I can, but Utor here won't be of much use. He's... well... younger than he looks, I'm afraid.~
@3255  = ~Who are you and what is your position here?~
@3256  = ~Who do you think is behind these disappearances?~
@3257  = ~Can you think of a motive for these kidnappings?~
@3258  = ~Who me? I am Hastenback. I have my studies here like all the rest of the brethren. I also tend to the gardens and watch over Utor as well. Shame about him really. Once was a brilliant mage I hear. Apparently he found some ancient tome in a ruin somewhere. Full of forgotten magic that was not quite... compatible with the human mind. He's about three seasons old now, I reckon. Couldn't even walk when he first came here. A shame it is.~
@3259  = ~Thank you for your time.~
@3260  = ~Who do you think is behind these disappearances?~
@3261  = ~Can you think of a motive for these kidnappings?~
@3262  = ~That be quite the question. If I had an easy answer for it, I venture we wouldn't need you around, would we? Not that people haven't gained from the loss, mind you. I don't much like how quickly the abbot and captain were replaced, but I suppose that was a matter of necessity. Still... some have adapted to their new positions quicker than others.~
@3263  = ~Thank you for your time.~
@3264  = ~Can you think of a motive for these kidnappings?~
@3265  = ~Who are you and what is your position here?~
@3266  = ~None too subtle, are you? I cannot say what would drive someone to steal another away in the night. Pride, envy, lust: these are the classics, of course. All are as likely as any other I could name, though I don't know if they apply in this case. One thing is certain; we are under siege. It's a quiet siege to be sure, but a siege nonetheless.~
@3267  = ~It was nothing, I am quite sure.~
@3268  = ~Fiend! He is but a child inside! Help!~
@3269  = ~Leave me! I would be alone!~
@3270  = ~Thank you for your time.~
@3271  = ~Who do you think is behind these disappearances?~
@3272  = ~Who are you and what is your position here?~
@3273  = ~I heard the commotion! What the...? Kobolds? It is very strange, very strange indeed!~
@3274  = ~Why do you say that? What do monks know of monsters?~
@3275  = ~They are but a couple of wandering creatures. Nothing of concern.~
@3276  = ~They are dead. I need to know nothing more than that!~
@3277  = ~If you say so, but ask yourself this: If they be wandering monsters, WHERE did they wander FROM? Kobolds never stray far from their clans, and there are NO clans in the area. What e'er your enemy be, they are not always what they seem. Good eve to you.~
@3278  = ~Monks know a great deal. The keep be full of tomes dedicated to the subject. For instance, kobolds are known social creatures. That means they prefer to travel and live in large communities. There are no such communities around, neither have there been any in this area for nigh on a hundred years. What does that tell you?~
@3279  = ~Bah! Book learnin' is no substitute for firsthand experience! I know they die at the end of a blade, and that is enough!~
@3280  = ~It tells me there is something odd about monsters that wander so far afield of where they should be.~
@3281  = ~Indeed. It would seem there may be more to fear here than meets the eye. I wish you luck and good fortune.~
@3282  = ~Hmm. Killing is the easy part to understand. It's what brought it into being in the first place that's the hard part to grasp. Luck be with you, for you will need it.~
@3283  = ~I fear I cannot help you. My duties rarely bring me outside.~
@3284  = ~I know nothing of this business! Leave me be!~
@3285  = ~Oh, very well. I am Eldoth, and I am captain of the guard here at the keep. I'll not tolerate your nosing about, and I don't care what duke of whatever city sent you! Keep your best behavior, or I shall be forced to turn you out!~
@3286  = ~There is no need for this. We are here to aid in the search for your lost compatriots. We do not mean to step on your toes.~
@3287  = ~As I heard it, you are but the "acting" captain. Should you not be more concerned with the return of your true leader?~
@3288  = ~I go where I wish! You have already demonstrated how ineffective you are! It's best we clean up your little mess for you!~
@3289  = ~My compatriots are in no need of your help. We shall manage their rescue just fine without you. Best you go to the guesthouse and stay out of our way.~
@3290  = ~I'll have you know that it is I who rules this roost, and I'll not have you "Gallihading" about. I am Captain of what little guard is left, and we shall manage fine without help from you!~
@3291  = ~I should watch whom you threaten! Since I am the duly appointed captain of the guard, it is WELL within my power to have you taken out and flogged! If I were in your position, I should just go to the guesthouse and stay there!~
@3292  = ~I did warn you about poking around. Now I fear I must... I fear... I must kill you!~
@3293  = ~Free? My mind is free! His blasted evil tentacles have been ripped out! Please, I have been under such a wicked spell! It was Krotan who made me... made me... Oh, by all the gods, what have I done?! Such things I could not have... such things I was made to do... I must tell you! There is a great evil at work amongst us, and it is an ogre mage of considerable power. The knowledge of the Keep is what he seeks, and he has been gathering forces these last weeks. I was his... pawn and have killed for him... killed friends for him! PLEASE! I can show you where he is hiding if you will but let me help in taking his head!~
@3294  = ~This is trickery! You have kidnapped and murdered and now you wish to save your skin. It is to no avail! You die tonight!~
@3295  = ~I trust you not an inch farther than I can throw you, and do not think I am not tempted to try! We will fight him, but you must remain here. Where can we find him?~
@3296  = ~I know not whether to trust you, but if you have been treated as you say I cannot deny you right of vengeance. Fight with us for right and justice!~
@3297  = ~No! I must live to take my vengeance! If I have to go through you, then so be it!~
@3298  = ~As... As you wish it. He has concealed his growing forces beneath the old Mausoleum. You will find him there, if you have the key to access it. Here it is. Take it... Take it, and send that vile creature thrice through the Hells!~
@3299  = ~I've the blood of my fellows on my hands... Tonight I will see if the blood of evil be the same color as that of the innocent. Come, he hides beneath the Mausoleum, gathering strength. There we must go!~
@3300  = ~No...! The blood... The blood is on my hands...~
@3301  = ~I'll kill you for what you... for what I did! It's all because of YOU!~
@3302  = ~Yes...~
@3303  = ~What?! Well, I guess me have visitors. Do come in. Are these ones you saw above?~
@3304  = ~Then good indeed! I not need to find myself! Ah, Eldoth. I should expect traitor to traitor me too. No matter. A useful tool you. A useful tool your skull be next!~
@3305  = ~You will kill no more! Now ME kill! KILL THEM! KILL THEM AND THE KEEP BE OURS!~
@3306  = ~What?! Well, I guess me have visitors. Do come in. Are these ones you saw above?~
@3307  = ~Then good indeed! I not need to find myself!~
@3308  = ~He no hear you. But a tool he is, and GOOD tool too. Weak will. Weaker SKULL!~
@3309  = ~No longer need tools! We strike now! KILL THEM! KILL THEM AND THE KEEP BE OURS!~
@3310  = ~What?! Well, I guess me have visitors. Do come in. Are these ones you saw above?~
@3311  = ~Then good indeed! I not need to find myself! Clever you are to have made it this far. Clever I am for letting you! Now you die here nice and clean. Tomorrow the Keep is mine! KILL THEM!~
@3312  = ~Ye brash fool! That gnome had a touch of madness, but now our party is short a man! We are weaker without him!~
@3313  = ~We will make do without him and proceed with caution. Our virtue will see us through.~
@3314  = ~You guys really should get permission from Emerson 'fore you enter the mines. He can get really nasty 'bout unauthorized guys wandering 'bout his mines.~
@3315  = ~What are ya doing in my home?! Get outta here 'fore I have ta hurt ya.~
@3316  = ~Who are you? What do ya want? FATHER! There's strangers in the kitchen!~

@3320  = ~Hello. Could you please be very quiet? My mother is asleep, and I don't wish to wake her. What is it that you need?~
@3321  = ~What?! Okay, take everything. -sob-... There's nothing I can do against armed adventurers.~
@3322  = ~You're back! What happened? Did you find Joseph?~
@3323  = ~Sorry we found nothing.~
@3324  = ~We found his greenstone ring, but I'm afraid we think he's dead.~
@3325  = ~All I know about the mines is that men keep on disappearing in their hellish depths. My husband is one of the miners, but he hasn't been home for weeks.~
@3326  = ~Thanks.~
@3327  = ~Maybe we could help you. We're thinking of exploring the mines. Describe your husband for us. Maybe we'll see him.~

@3339  = ~Hey, <GIRLBOY>s, if ye're interested in winnin' easy, ya should try the craps table. A roll of the bones is yer best bet for quick cash. I wouldn't play too long though. You lose in the long run.~
@3340  = ~My dear! Common riffraff running about my house. Perhaps all of you could be so kind as to leave, at once. I'm off on important business, and I really can't have strangers stomping about my home. When I get back, please make sure that you're gone.~
@3341  = ~Who in the Seven Heavens are all of you?! Why, you didn't even have the common decency to remove your footwear. Look at all of the mud you've tracked over the house! Get out! Leave! Begone!~

@3351  = ~Hey I remember you. Your father was Gorion, wasn't he? You should see all of the strange fellows who've come to the keep these days. Three men work for that mercantile organization, Iron Throne I think they called it. They've been meeting with the two spookiest people I've ever seen. It's like clockwork: Every day they meet on the third floor to discuss who knows what kind of dastardly plots. Ha ha, I'm sure they're just boring old merchants counting their money.~

@3360  = ~Bah! This cause is but a paltry diversion! It is a mere alleyway astride the road to greatness Tiax travels! If not for a... ahem... debt to the Baldur's Gate guard, Tiax would nary be here at all! Do as you will, but it is for naught! Tiax must rule!~

(Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell is similar to the invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. Note, however, that there are sometimes telltale traces, a shimmering, so that an observant opponent can attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made his presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character's saving throws are made with a +4 bonus.~

@5689  = ~I have a passing knowledge of magery. Can you not dispel this... ahem... foul condition?~
@5690  = ~I would but dispel is beyond my... er... rather, I exhausted my *cluck* memorized spells earlier, and now I cannot... access my spellbook. Have you or a member of your party the *cluck* ability to cast such a spell?~
@5691  = ~It's most likely a godly retribution for some past offense or indiscretion! I'll not meddle in such affairs!~
@5692  = ~Perhaps... but what shall be our reward? 'Twould seem such a spell would be worth much to you, at this particular time especially.~
@5693  = ~Of course, we shall have you restored in short order. Do not move until the casting be done.~
@5694  = ~It's a spell neither I, nor my comrades can cast at this time. Is there another way I might assist you?~
@5695  = ~Is there anyone that might be able to assist you? I fear I have little in the way of magical power myself.~
@5696  = ~REWARD?! Forgive me-cluck-, but I seem to have left my purse in my other robe! *sigh* Free me and I shall give you what *cluck* gold I have. 'Tis a meager amount, but 'tis *cluck* yours.~
@5697  = ~Then we shall have you restored post haste. Hold still while the casting is done.~
@5698  = ~Now that it's determined you have money to give, I confess we do not have that spell available to us. I will aid you as best I can some other way, for the same reward of course.~
@5699  = ~Blast it all! Well, there is nothing else I *cluck* can do except my most hated option. There is a tower directly to the west of *cluck* Beregost, about which can be found the mage Thalantyr. I am his... apprentice, and I am... certain he will *cluck* aid me.~
@5700  = ~Then to his abode we shall go. I will escort you.~
@5701  = ~For being his apprentice you seem unsure of his willingness to help you.~
@5702  = ~It's too far afield for us. You will have to find your own way.~
@5703  = ~Oh, 'tis nothing -cluck-... REALLY! Um, often the relationship between *cluck* apprentice and master is... strained. He will help. I am... certain.~
@5704  = ~Then to his abode we shall go. I will escort you.~
@5705  = ~Regardless, it's too far out of our way. You will have to make your own way there.~
@5706  = ~It didn't *cluck* work! Bother and Blast, your skill is no better than mi— Um... rather, I fear that *cluck* you have not the ability to release... my enchantment. My only *cluck* recourse now is to find my... master. Would you take me to the *cluck* tower near Beregost? 'Tis there we will find Thalantyr. He might hel— Er... should be able to deal with *cluck* this.~
@5707  = ~Then to his abode we shall go. I will escort you.~
@5708  = ~For being his apprentice you seem unsure of his willingness to help you.~
@5709  = ~It's too far afield for us. You will have to find your own way.~
@5710  = ~Thank you! It's located just to the west of Beregost. Thalantyr lives in a large manor there. I'll just nestle in your pack until we get there.~
@5711  = ~Ho there! I am Bentan, most devout follower of the great, broken Ilmater. I wonder if any of you follow the path of the Crying God?~
@5712  = ~Why would we have any reason to follow such a boring and pointless god?~
@5713  = ~No, none of us worship Ilmater.~
@5714  = ~Yes, a few of us do offer daily prayers to the One Who Endures All.~
@5715  = ~Of course! Not one among our party would think of venerating any but the great god Ilmater.~
@5716  = ~I will forgive your rudeness, for the lot of you must simply be misled. I wish to explain to you the wonders of Ilmater, so listen closely.~
@5717  = ~So none of you venerate Ilmater. Well then, we must rectify this at once. Listen closely while I tell you the wonders that will come once you have converted to Ilmater's faith.~
@5718  = ~Some of you worship Ilmater, but not all?! Well, all I can say is that those among you who venerate the Crying God must be lax in your duties. For those among you who have not been enlightened to the true faith, listen closely.~
@5719  = ~Why. I am so pleased to have met such a group! I am giddy with joy, I think I will have to administer some self-flagellation just to calm myself down. I would stick around to swap stories, but you know how it is, so many to convert, so little time!~
@5720  = ~Now, as you've probably heard, Ilmater is the god of suffering. Most people immediately perceive this as the suffering one must endure themselves, but trust me, the stories you have heard are most likely wild and unrealistic. Suffering in the service of Ilmater does eventually come, but lo! It is the most joyful of sensations, and opens your eyes to wisdom. Once you have suffered in the service of Ilmater, you will have your eyes opened to the evils of the world. Evils such as avarice, greed, lust, perversity, and most especially magic! By magic, I mean not the holy power granted by Ilmater, but rather the wicked powers wielded by sorcerers!~
@5721  = ~You're very boring old man, I think we'll be leaving.~
@5722  = ~Excuse us, but some of us are sorcerers.~
@5723  = ~Keep talking.~
@5724  = ~Boring?! You think that Ilmater is boring?! WHY you... you...! I should... I will be leaving now!~
@5725  = ~Some of you are sorcerers! By all that's good and holy, you must stop your evil ways. Magic only leads to pain and misery, it is a wicked art I tell you... a wicked art. Though I find it painful to stand in the presence of such vile necromancers, I will continue my sermon.~
@5726  = ~Rumors? Bah! There is no mage here that wishes to speak or be spoken of. Unless, of course, if you have magic that you wish to sell.~
@5727  = ~All you have to do to become a faithful of Ilmater, is to cast off your worldly possessions. You will wander the world, and suffer in the place of others. You will spread the word as I have spread it to you. Well, what think you? Will you cast off your possessions and become a faithful of Ilmater?~
@5728  = ~I have met an unfortunate wizard in the shape of a chicken. I am to take him to see Thalantyr, just to the west of Beregost.~
@5729  = ~Sorry old man, but we have better things to do.~
@5730  = ~What you speak of is intriguing, but we just don't have the time or inclination.~
@5731  = ~Certainly! We'll get rid of everything we own, right NOW! You may consider us faithful to Ilmater!~
@5732  = ~You are foolish in your decision; your minds obviously clouded by the numerous vices all of you must engage in. I pity the whole lot of you, goodbye!~
@5733  = ~I am sorry that you feel that way. I tried, Ilmater knows I tried! I hope that your young and gullible minds aren't perverted by the evil forces that roam the world. Goodbye.~
@5734  = ~I am so joyous! You have made the most important decisions of your lives. I wish I could guide you in your coming journeys, but that is Ilmater's duty. Ilmater bless all of you, goodbye!~
@5735  = ~I cannot tarry about for idle conversation. As a knight, there are many tasks that must be looked after! If you wish to join me in my tasks, then just say the word. Otherwise, leave me be.~
@5736  = ~~
@5737  = ~I don't think that I have anything to say to you! Why don't you leave me be?!~
@5738  = ~Then just follow me into the Merchants' League Estate. You may begin the investigation as soon as you get inside. I shall be waiting for any reports of your progress on the second floor.~
@5739  = ~I am Aldeth Sashenstar. Along with my partners, Zorl and Irlentree, I run the Merchants' League in Baldur's Gate. I am a very rich man.~
@5740  = ~I must thank you for saving my consortium! I will reward all of you greatly for what you have done for me. I hope what I give you now is reward enough. This sword is a family heirloom, and could be useful if you were ever to run into those shapeshifting creatures again. Know that if ever you are in trouble, you can come to my estate.~
@5741  = ~I'm sorry, but I have much to do in rebuilding my shattered consortium. Perhaps we will meet again.~
@5742  = ~I have captured the supposedly murderous Brage. Now I need but return him to the garrison or the temple in Nashkel. If he is delivered to the garrison he will surely be killed, but I know not what the temple intends.~
@5743  = ~I have had to kill the berserking Brage, and I need but return his body to Nashkel for my reward. To the garrison or to the temple: I must decide which.~
@5744  = ~I will resist you not at all. Lead me to mine fate.~
@5745  = ~My companions and I have an interest in the mines. Tell me what you know.~
@5746  = ~The tale of the guard sounds interesting. Please, do tell.~
@5747  = ~I have no time for tales. There are far better things to be doing.~
@5748  = ~I'm just a thief. Sorry, but I don't have much to tell.~
@5749  = ~I'm only a guard. I don't think I have much to tell you.~
@5750  = ~I'm only a guard. All I know are the rumors flying about town.~
@5751  = ~Hey, friend, all I know is that there's been trouble in the mines, some sort of dog people, I've heard.~
@5752  = ~Would you consent to another tale? I also have an interest in the story of the captain of the guard.~
@5753  = ~I'm just yer average guard. I don't wanna run into those dog people who've been killin' everyone.~
@5754  = ~I have heard as much from common rumors about the street outside. Your tale is but a long-winded version.~

@5760  = ~Would you consent to another tale? I also have an interest in the mines.~

@5765  = ~I have not time for your fanciful stories. Leave me be.~
@5766  = ~The word is that all across the expansive Sword Coast, from the Cloud Peaks to Baldur's Gate, an ore shortage is severely crippling local trade. Bandits—purportedly both human AND demihuman—raid caravans, whilst ore reaching its destination becomes brittle and useless following smelting, strangely afflicted by an odd, iron-weakening plague. As though this were not cause for alarm in itself, production at the mines outside of Nashkel has fallen, with the substantially lower yields being blamed on nervous workers. Mysterious disappearances of several miners have set the whole area on edge, where something must shift the balance to one side or the other.~
@5767  = ~I hear that Commander Brage, of the Amnian guard, has been missing for some weeks now, following a strange alteration in his behavior. Where once he was a well-thought-of family man, he has turned to senseless mayhem, effecting a rampage the likes of which I have never heard. His fellow soldiers noted nothing out of sorts that could trigger such a transformation, but one notable item seems relevant. If not for the iron shortage it would have gone unnoticed but, prior to his mad rage, the commander procured a new sword. The importance of this information, I have no way of verifying.~

@6106  = ~I can tell you of my curse, for that is all I remember anymore. I used to be beautiful and powerful. An exotic sorceress, with many powers at my command and suitors at my door. But I only had eyes for one man, Jon Irenicus. He was a great and powerful wizard, the only man worthy of my affections, or so I thought. Though I lusted for Jon, he cared little for me, for he had another to whom he was married, Lady Tanova. So I plotted and schemed, and finally came up with a plan to rid the world of Tanova. When the deed was done and Tanova lay dead, I was exultant, but not for long. Jon went mad with fury, and using his powerful magics, divined the identity of his wife's murderer. He arrived at my tower, and I allowed him entry, desirous to finally consummate our love. Jon disabled me with his spells, then he cursed me to this body and set spiders to feed me and keep me alive. So you see, if you were my friend, you would kill me.~

@6110  = ~I'm your best friend! It's a strange feeling being friends with such as you; after all, you're far beneath me in intellect and possess very few good mannerisms. I doubt I can tell you much that you would find useful; most of my work is far beyond your limited perceptions. I'm sorry that I could not be more useful as a friend.~
@6111  = ~I have no time to waste with you right now, so could you kindly be on your way?~
@6112  = ~What knowledge would you like from me? I could tell you about the beautiful forests of Tethyr, or the many gorgeous damsels that have fallen for my charms.

@6114  = ~I am Dabron Sashenstar, brother of Aldeth Sashenstar. I've been away from Baldur's Gate for many years, as I am an explorer.

@6115  = ~You must gather your party before venturing forth.~ [NOTRAV]
@6116  = ~As I have told you, I am the mighty magician Davaeorn! I serve Rieltar of the Iron Throne. It is my duty to keep this mine running at peak efficiency. This mine used to be in the possession of a clan of dwarves. They mined into the side of river, and most of the dwarves died in the ensuing flood. The Iron Throne has moved in and plugged the river with a magical seal. If anyone were to use the key I keep in my bedroom chest, they could open the seal and flood the mines. That would be a very bad disaster for the Iron Throne. Indeed, yes it would.~
@6117  = ~Illegal, eh? What's in it for me to take such a risk?~
@6118  = ~I'll have none of this, sir! Be thankful I don't turn you over to the guard!~

@6127  = ~What are you still doing here? You have much to do, hurry!~
@6128  = ~I'm back! I hope you all missed me dearly.~
@6129  = ~Well, as your best friend I can tell you a few things. There's been some economic trouble in Baldur's Gate. There's been a lack of iron, and with the tensions between Amn and Baldur's Gate, this has been causing some concern. A mercantile organization called the Iron Throne has been making some headway within the economic circles of Baldur's Gate.~

@6135  = ~Being a good friend of yours and all, I can tell you this: There's a bunch a mean dog-like creatures killin' me men in the mine. Ya gotta stop 'em!~
@6136  = ~I am Entar Silvershield, one of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate! I can tell you many things, friend. Perhaps you'd care to hear about the Iron Throne. They're a new mercantile organization that have set up in Baldur's Gate. Most of us are rather concerned over some of the Iron Throne's actions, but they have promised to supply us with iron, a resource that has been very rare of late. We are suspicious of Amn, our neighbor to the south. We think that Amn has allied with the Zhentarim in an attempt to annex our glorious city. However, Scar feels that the evidence against Amn was too easy to come by, almost as if someone were trying to frame Amn to cause friction between our two nations. Since you are my best friend, I should tell you I have a very beautiful daughter. Her name is Skie, and she is now of marriageable age.~
@6137  = ~Hmm. A bold statement were I an orc or a hobgoblin. I am, however, not someone it would be wise for you to attack. I should let this threat go no further if I were you. Be a good little adventurer and leave me be.~
@6138  = ~Have you changed your minds about combating the evil of the Iron Throne? Join me, and together we can end the defiling of the Cloakwood.~
@6139  = ~I am Faldorn, a member of the Shadow Druids. The Shadow Druids are a sect of druids that believes in the destruction of civilization. I have come to this region of the world to sow disorder among those druid sects that are too weak to share our vision.~

@6161  = ~If that is what you wish, though a little interaction might do you some good. It is rumored you gave up the company of adventurers, but I would hazard a bet that you would enjoy a dungeon romp every now and then.~
@6162  = ~Spare me your sanctimonious tone, old mage. I have brought this man here and now will leave you be.~
@6163  = ~I would just as soon have done with both of you, but I will settle for just the one leaving. I will do the minimum that I can for this unfortunate fowl.~
@6164  = ~You know nothing of me! Best that you pray, to whatever deity turns your crank, that you NEVER face what I have seen. Bah! The inexperience and STUPIDITY of youth.

@6183  = ~A student wishes to LEARN, while this fool wishes only to have knowledge. I will tutor no one who does not understand the ramifications of what I have to teach! Not getting the quick gratification he wished, he instead chose to steal from me!~
@6184  = ~You speak of so much, but show so little! I only wished to *cluck* learn a fraction of the power you possess!~
@6185  = ~It has taken me some fifty-odd years of life to gain the power I wield, and the will not to use it. You are but a baby in comparison. Frankly, I'm surprised you changed into such an OLD chicken! How DID you manage that, by the by? You were muddling the simplest cantrip when last I observed you.~
@6186  = ~I have progressed much since then... and I *cluck* "borrowed" a few items to speed the process.~
@6187  = ~As I thought. Well, it's obvious you can steal my tools, but not my understanding of them. Hold still while I dispel this foolish facade.

@6220  = ~Why, yes, mercenary, they might be considered priceless to some. As priceless as any value you can place on suffering or pain. I may know a scholar or two that would give their mothers for them, but 'tis not enough. It could never be enough. It really doesn't matter at this point regardless, as the damage is done and they have most likely disappeared. They have teleported away in the past after use, and 'twas but sheer luck alone that returned them to me.~
@6221  = ~They are a relic of my adventuring days, and a monument to the years I spent enslaved beneath... beneath where, I cannot say. 'Twas foolish to be anywhere near a Netherese ruin, but I was young and stupid once as well. I was entrapped... I will say no more about that. I escaped, and brought what I could. The bracers remain a mystery, and I have no idea their true function. In the past I have seen them wielded for horrific purpose, but any HUMAN that put them on was instantly killed as often as not.

I will tell you want you want to hear, and then I shall kill you. Does this satisfy you? No matter, let me begin: Once, there were three pigs who had built a house of iron. This house had brought them fortune and comfort, but it was now threatened by the big bad wolf! So the three pigs hired out a small man named Nimbul. "Nimbul," they said, "You must kill this wolf for us. If you do this, you will be given much gold to line your pockets." So Nimbul set out to kill the wolf, but then something happened that he never expected: Nimbul fell in love with the wolf! So now, to Nimbul's sorrow, he must carry out this order and end the wolf's life. Goodbye!~

Bandits have been attacking caravans, but strangely, they have been stealing iron, rather than gold or other valuables. On a curiously similar vein, the iron mines of Nashkel have been the source of some mischief. Someone, or something has been killing the miners who delve there.

If you are reading this, it means I have met an untimely death. I would tell you not to grieve for me, but I feel much better thinking that you would. There are things I must tell you in this letter that I might have told you before. However, if my death came too soon, then I would have never been given the chance. First off, I am not your biological father, for that distinction lies with an entity known as Bhaal. The Bhaal that I speak of is the one you know of as a divinity. In the crisis known as the Time of Troubles, when the gods walked Faerun, Bhaal was also forced into a mortal shell. He was somehow forewarned of the death that awaited him during this time. For reasons unknown to me, he sought out women of every race and forced himself upon them. Your mother was one of those women, and as you know, she died in childbirth. I had been her friend and, on occasion, lover. I felt obligated to raise you as my own. I have always thought of you as my child, and I hope you still think of me as your father. You are a special child. The blood of the gods runs through your veins. If you make use of our extensive library, you will find that our founder, Alaundo, has many prophecies concerning the coming of the spawn of Bhaal. There are many who will want to use you for their own purposes. One, a man who calls himself Sarevok, is the worst danger. He has studied here at Candlekeep and thus knows a great deal about your history and who you are.

This inheritor will shape the history of the Sword Coast for centuries to come...~
@6486  = ~The spawn of the Lord of Murder are fated to come into their inheritance through bloodshed and misery. It is the hope of their father that only one shall remain alive to inherit his legacy. I foresee that the children of Bhaal shall kill each other in a bloody massacre.~

@6488  = ~My servant Mulahey,
Your progress in disrupting the flow of iron ore does not go as well as it should. How stupid can you be to allow your kobolds to murder the miners?! With your presence revealed, you should be wary of enemies sent to stop your operation. Your task is a very simple one; if you continue to show that you can't do the job, you will be replaced. I will not send the kobolds you have requested as I need all the troops I possess to stop the flow of iron into this region. With this message I have sent more of the mineral poison that you require. If you have any problems then send a message to my new contact in Beregost. His name is Tranzig, and he'll be staying at Feldepost's Inn.

Tazok~
@6489  = ~My servant Mulahey,
I have sent you the kobolds and mineral poison that you require. Your task is to poison any iron ore that leaves these mines. Don't reveal your presence to the miners or you will find yourself swamped by soldiers from the local Amnian garrison. My superiors have recently hired on the services of the Blacktalon mercenaries and the Chill. With these soldiers at my disposal, I should be able to destroy any iron caravans entering the region from the south and east. I don't want to deal with iron coming from the Nashkel mines, so don't fail in your duty.

Tazok~
@6490  = ~Tranzig,
I am perplexed as to why Mulahey has not communicated with us in some while. You are to go to the mines and find out the condition of his operation. You are also to collect any iron that may have been stolen by the kobolds. Our next raid will most likely take place at Peldvale or Larswood, so visit either of those areas and track us back to our camp.

Tazok~
@6491  = ~Davaeorn,
I have received your request for extra slaves. They will be sent as soon as possible. Events go well in Baldur's Gate. We have purchased one of the western noble estates to use as our base of operations. It is an ancient building, most likely constructed before the erection of the second wall. Its construction makes it very defensible against those who would thieve it. Remember to ask Yeslick if he enjoys his new accommodations.

Alturiak, 1365~
@6492  = ~Davaeorn,
Our plans go smoothly. Sarevok has arrived from our headquarters in Ordulin. He brings news from our superiors; they are pleased with our progress so far. I plan to place Sarevok as the commander of our mercenary forces in the region. He has already sent his subordinate, Tazok, to the Wood of Sharp Teeth to take command of the forces located there. Things go apace here in Baldur's Gate. We have placed our first agent among the ranks of the Seven Suns trading coster.

Rieltar
Flamerule, 1367~
@6493  = ~Davaeorn,
As you have probably heard, the iron poison has begun to take effect around the coast. With the majority of iron imports being disrupted by Tazok, almost all of it comes from the tainted source in Nashkel. The Sythillisian uprising in Amn has ensured that no forces from that nation will be able to take action against our mercenary forces. However, the Flaming Fist has caught several of the Blacktalon mercenaries. All of those captured have claimed allegiance with the Zhentarim and have thus shifted any suspicion away from the Iron Throne. I have sent Tranzig to work with the mercenaries in transporting the iron to your base in Cloakwood. He has brought several bags of holding so that he, alone, will make trips into Cloakwood, thereby lessening the chance that Flaming Fist trackers might find your stronghold.

@6527  = ~There must be a dead element, yes. That is what the skull is for. I cannot fully explain what I am to try, but it's something of a reversal on the reincarnation scheme.

@7282  = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history. Over 3,000 years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin. When Raurin fell in 2488 DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia. Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged. Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy: All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity. Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life. Merchants were honored above all. In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants. During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the Council of Merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries. War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was lifethreatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement. During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed. Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath. The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every able-bodied fighting man they sent. The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts. He could not pass up such an advantage and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time. He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things. He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade. He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems. He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life. Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range. They roamed as far east as Kara-Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa. At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~

@7283  = ~History of Tethyr:

For the past 1,500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power. When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne. As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne. Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so).

The established re-occurring cycle was broken ten years ago. The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr. King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr. Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well. Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethyr by royal armies. Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury. These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change.

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however; It takes treachery as well. In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and impatient royal heir. Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army. While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile. By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help.

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates. At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father. A fire set by the elite troops would destroy the evidence of treachery and the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government.

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point. Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire. At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid.

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family. Once Castle Tethyr began to fall, there was no holding back the mob. In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin. Everything of value—fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, and so on—was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust.

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos. In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword. This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding."

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell. Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived. These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr.

One thing was certain: any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted. "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society. The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~

@7284  = ~History of Amn:

Amn has the good fortune to have abundant natural resources; some would say Amn is the richest land on the continent. This has worked in Amn's favor for generations, because even if they were conquered, the new masters would be gentle, looking to gain wealth from the land, rather than to put it to the torch.

Amn has been a center of trade and commerce for as long as anyone can remember. Oral traditions handed down from father to son tend to support the theory that Amn has been a trade center for at least 800 years. Unfortunately, written records are difficult to find and often incomplete. It would seem the typical Amnian citizen was too busy trying to fill their coffers to write down events of the day.

Amn has always been more interested in the present and the future than the past, and this makes an accurate history difficult. The best records, the business papers of the oldest trading companies, are jealously guarded. The fear of revealing "trade secrets" is stronger than the call of history, so the average citizen knows very little about Amn's past.

It appears that the Amn of 100 years ago was very much like the Calimshan of today. Each major city was basically an independent entity, banding together for defense when necessary and fighting for control of territory and profitable trade routes the rest of the time. A particularly brutal trade war began twenty-four years ago, with each city exacting prohibitive tariffs on goods imported from the others. The trade war escalated, and city troops began to raid caravans sponsored by other cities. In a matter of months commerce was brought to a halt, a number of cities were under siege, and war threatened to engulf the entire region.

Into the breach stepped a young merchant named Thayze Selemchant. Thayze was smart, charismatic, and very well connected: the Selemchant trading house was one of the oldest and richest in Athkatla. He secretly contacted representatives of the five other richest merchant houses in Amn, and started to plan.

The first part of the plan involved the careful sprinkling of rumors about outside threats. One involved a pirate invasion from the Nelanther, another was about a massing of orcs just on the other side of the Cloud Peaks. Thayze even started a rumor about an elf army in the Forest of Tethyr, ready to pounce on a divided Amn. None of the rumors were true, but they began to turn people's thoughts toward unity, not war.

Thayze knew that if he and the other members of his council were to take control of Amn, they would need broad-based popular support. Tensions between cities and merchant houses were still high, so to get that support, Selemchant and the others agreed to drop their family names and never use them again.

When news of a "Council of Six" spread throughout the land, many people accepted their rule. A group that would unite Amn under one rule, governing for the benefit of all instead of one city or trading company over another, was indeed a welcome change. The Council raised an army (at great personal expense) to quell the few pockets of resistance that remained and has been in total control of Amn for the past twenty-two years.~

@7285  = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire. Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinn and efreet started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there. Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places—Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr—took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change. As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born. It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the Realms. Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn. The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim. A force that great they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the Realms, and that didn't happen. Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land. There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its own power over its own area. About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land. Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do. The oldest son of each pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one. The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over eighteen years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan forty-four years ago.~
@7286  = ~History of Estagund:

Estagund history follows a different path than those of Durpar and Var. The Gunders were conquered in 551 DR by Reinhar I, warchief of the Arkaiuns of Dambrath. It regained its independence when Reinhar was slain by the Halruaan archmage Mycontil, though the country soon degenerated into a group of small independent city states.

Skirmishes with Var, and between the city-states, continued for several centuries until a king once again united the country. King Bornial was a skilled ruler, and under him Estagund began to prosper. His descendants did not share his wisdom, and in 1023 DR, King Selkarin more than illustrated this. He had failed to conquer Durpar, and Veldorn resisted his challenges. An avowed misogynist, Selkarin turned his attentions to the matriarchy of Dambrath. He led a large fleet to attack Dambrath, taking extreme losses, including his own life. Selkarin died childless, so his brother Hedgita was crowned King. The new ruler faced a country with most of its fighting men gone, and an unforeseen problem: famine. The famine was caused by a blight that wiped out nearly all the year's crops in Estagund. This made him eager for a deal posed by the Durparian merchant Jeradeem Seltarir, and in a legendary trade the entire country of Estagund was sold. Contrary to popular rumor, Hedgita did not trade away the country for 24 pearls. In actuality he received diamonds worth almost a million gold pieces. The sudden wealth gave him an instant seat on the council of merchants, so he retained a measure of rule in addition to his fortune. Chaka Hedgita is still the richest chaka in Estagund to this day. In the years that followed, the Gunders began rebuilding their lives under their new circumstance, and now they compete on equal footing with the merchants of Durpar and Var.~
@7287  = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King:

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire. This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel. It was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains, south and west of Wyvernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar, and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes.

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade. He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales—all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne.

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days. The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed. His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone. One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone. King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade.

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend. Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere. When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns.

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence. His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes. Caravan guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, "else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne." Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self-professed neutral alignment. If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule. Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state. Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.~
@7288  = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra:

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known. One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess's other actions during that period, is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate. The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen. This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission. It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals. Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.)

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable. One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun. Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted. Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate. Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved. To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives.

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Dornal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter. Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to. Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body. Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Dornal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor.

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter. Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Eresseae Qilue. These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters.

Dornal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; He had always wanted sons as well as daughters. More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell—in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her.

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power. To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body.

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme. Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess. He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North. Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final thirty years of his life. When Dornal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant. Now known as the Watcher, Dornal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.~
@7289  = ~History of Shadowdale - The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshall of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshal of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; However, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~
@7290  = ~History of Shadowdale - Ashaba Becomes First Lord of Shadowdale:

Upon taking the Twisted Tower and removing the drowish yoke from the people, the Dalesmen had fully established the Dale of Shadowdale, with its seat of power in the tower itself. Its first lord was a water wizard who had aided in the final attack: Ashaba, who was great in age when he ascended, and ruled peacefully for forty years thereafter. It is said that Ashaba realized he was dying and turned himself to water, merging with the river. Since that time, the river, the ford, and the Twisted Tower all bear his name. Before passing on Ashaba chose one of his trusted lieutenants as the new lord of Shadowdale. Presented to the people of the Dale, he was made the new lord by acclamation. In an additional honor, the pendant worn by Ashaba was thereafter recognized as a symbol of the lordship in the Dalelands, and was possessed by each of the successive lords following.~
@7291  = ~History of Shadowdale - Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre:

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale. All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home. A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs. During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll. Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale. The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune. Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.~
@7292  = ~History of Shadowdale - Aumry Rules in Peace:

The longest period of peaceful rule was by Lord Aumry and his wife Sylune (better known as the Witch of Shadowdale). They ruled over the community for forty years, a period of extended peace with their neighboring dales, nations, and the elven peoples. It was this very peace and power which made the Dale the target for attacks and sabotage by the Black Network (Zhentarim). They sought (and still seek) to control the trade from the Moonsea to the Sword Coast, and desired to make Shadowdale a vassal state of Zhentil Keep. Lord Aumry's rule ended tragically when he was assassinated by Zhentish agents.~
@7293  = ~History of Shadowdale - Jyordhan the False Lord:

Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse.

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.~
@7294  = ~History of Shadowdale - Khelben Kills Jyordhan:

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~
@7295  = ~History of Shadowdale - Lords Accepted by Acclamation:

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff. Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large. This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well. They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster). The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.~
@7296  = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords:

During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~
@7297  = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale:

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba(the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune(wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well.

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there is little validity to the claim.~
@7298  = ~History of Shadowdale - Elminster Moves to Shadowdale:

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area. A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement. The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes. The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.~
@7299  = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Chooses Mourngrym Amcathra to Succeed Him:

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years. "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra. Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers. Time has proven this choice a wise one.~
@7300  = ~History of Shadowdale - Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry:

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon. The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale). Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym. The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale. Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule. This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.~
@7301  = ~History of Shadowdale - Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped. The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender. Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan. While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR). When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle. In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters.

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old. By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community. Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his majority, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name. If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.~
@7302  = ~History of the North - The First Flowering:

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining). From their ornate forest cities, they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races. Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union. The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore. Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves. To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races.~
@7303  = ~History of the North - The Crown Wars:

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast. They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands. Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other, with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins. Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud. It enshrouded the kingdom of Miyeritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived—nor were trees left; only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor.

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day). They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants. Astonishingly, in at least three places—the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor—they succeeded with shining grace.

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder—a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over three thousand years, Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.~
@7304  = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was of great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command or the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races, however these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep—its slender, now-broken spires—can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~
@7305  = ~History of the Red Ravens:

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Red Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract. They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north. They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade. They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they do not wish to jeopardize their royal charter. Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords. They charge 200 gp per week for the services of their 110-being unit. Their symbol is a red raven amulet.~
@7306  = ~History of Dambrath:

The nation of Dambrath was formed out of a barbarian kingdom almost a half-millennium ago by a powerful alliance of priestesses of Loviatar and the drow from the city of T'lindhet.

In 211 DR, fleeing from the destruction of their homeland by the then-great kingdoms of Unther and Mulhorand, four tribes of barbarians entered Dambrath. They found a coast where the dolphins danced and plains where the grass was long. They roamed from the borders of the Walls of Halruaa, as far east as the current borders of Estagund. They soon became known as the Arkaiun, or "people of the wind."

In 545 DR a great warchief, Reinhar, arose to lead the tribes. The halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved, and several of the coastal cities of Durpar were captured or razed. Estagund fell to his rule, and eventually Reinhar turned his attention to Halruaa.

An army of 40,000 horsemen and a fleet of 50 ships mounted a coordinated attack, and even though Reinhar was able to get beyond the Walls of Halruaa and occupy the cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalsuu, their magics proved to be more than a match for the invaders. Reinhar was finally defeated in a great battle at Sulaziir by the archmage Mycontil and his troop of wizards.

Reinhar's son, Reinhar II, took command of the army and set out on a two-month overland retreat. He arrived home with a thousand surviving fighting men and no shaman. Reinhar II proved to be as good a ruler in defeat as his father was in war. He consolidated his forces and pulled home almost all of his troops, as he knew that the defeat made them tempting prey for raiders and encroaching monsters. This action allowed for the safe development of his peoples.

By the time the ninth Reinhar was king in 802 DR, the Arkaiuns were fat and lazy. Reinhar IX, or Reinhar the Foolish as he is more commonly known, insisted on expanding his nation to gain more gold to finance his military campaigns. He ordered the mining of many rich lodes of silver and electrum in the Gnollwatch Mountains, but before his plans of expansion could begin, the miners encountered the drow of T'lindhet. The drow were outraged and began a steady series of raids and attacks on the Arkaiun strongholds. Whole villages were destroyed overnight, and no trace of the invaders could be found.

Reinhar IX committed the foolhardy action of attacking the drow in retaliation. While the Arkaiuns managed to get a force into the drow city, this action only succeeded in uniting the normally chaotic drow. For once, the full power of a drow city was turned against an enemy.

The battle quickly moved back to the surface. Reinhar's raiders were wiped out, leaving Reinhar with only a small portion of his original military. This was not enough for the drow, who demanded total enslavement of the entire surface nation. The Arkaiuns resisted valiantly, and the war went on for three decades at tremendous cost in life to both sides.

Finally, the drow had the Arkaiun forces cornered at Malduir. Almost without hope, the defenders were overjoyed when a group of half-elven pilgrims appeared on the scene. The high priestess, Cathtyr Shintar, offered the aid of her clerics to help defend the city, and Reinhar took this to be an omen from the gods. A priestess was placed with almost every company.

Within a tenday the drow struck. The priestesses did indeed prove to be of great aid, but to the drow. Every priestess turned on the Arkaiuns, and Cathtyr herself slew Reinhar. The drow were still weakened by the battle, and only the presence of the priestesses enabled them to win. Cathtyr, realizing the unique advantage she possessed, made a deal that even the suspicious drow embraced. Her priestesses would rule the land, and in exchange they would provide access to the surface for the drow, trading weapons, slaves, and supplies.

The drow were delighted with this brazen offer from a surface dweller. Reinhar had been slain and the insult avenged, and after thirty years of war the drow were not particularly interested in Dambrath. They did insist, however, on taking the best captured males as slaves. Cathtyr quickly agreed to this, seeing the males as an obstacle to her own power.

Cathtyr ruled for 205 years. She fulfilled her promise to make Dambrath, or " The Nation of Pain," a bastion of evil in the Realms. In her time, Cathtyr saw the priesthood of Loviatar expand to thousands, and faith in the Beastlords previously worshiped by the Arkaiuns was nearly eradicated. Many of the Arkaiuns were able to escape their new mistresses and flee to the Swagdar. There they resumed their almost forgotten nomadic life.

The priestesses of Loviatar continued to enjoy good relations with the drow, and some even took mates, creating a race of drow half-elves. These dark half-elves became known as the Crintri, or "noble ones." Most are priestesses of Loviatar, though many are mages as well. They consolidated their power, learning much of the area from the Shebali, or "lower ones," as the Arkaiuns are now called. The capital of Dambrath was established at Cathtyr, built after Cathtyr's passing and named in her honor. Her death came at the hands of her daughter, Filina, who had grown tired of waiting for her mother to die. Filina ruled for only five years, however, before her own daughter, Cathakay, assumed the throne in the same fashion. Cathakay ruled for fifty-four years, eventually falling in battle against a gold dragon. She died childless, and her niece Melanith assumed the throne.

Melanith faced an increasing population and unrest among males who longed for a return to their prestige of old. Melanith did not return their previous status, but she did make use of them. Fearing that the great nations of Mulhorand and Unther might rise again, she decided that men would handle mundane tasks, such as the defense of the kingdom. She was the first to name a male to the post of warchief. Sadalar, a Crintri, became the queen's consort. Widespread bribery and corruption characterized his term as warchief. He was, however, responsible for getting many privileges returned to the Arkaiuns. After Melanith's rule, the Shebali were considered second class citizens, rather than slaves.

Though males were granted more power during her rule, Melanith also solidified the split between the sexes. While the rulers of Dambarth had been females for over two centuries, it was more because of competence than gender. Melanith, however, decreed that men could have no authority except over other men. The female-led hierarchy of Loviatar was quick to back this move.

Many of the bravest and best men of the kingdom perished in raids on Estagund, Durpar, the bandit tribes of Veldorn, and against the gnolls who had returned to the Gnollwatch Mountains. Some even fought at the side of the drow in their battle with the svirfneblin city of Aventine. The deep gnomes were destroyed, but so were the Shebali. The drow and the Crintri were largely unharmed, and for their aid, the Crintri were rewarded with a number of drow males to breed in to their race. Melanith took a drow male as her consort to replace Sadalar, who had perished in the conflict. The drow, Nym Inthigg, fathered three daughters and a son. It was at this time that Melantih began the isolationist policy that Dambrath still follows today.

Melanith ruled for 156 years, her daughter Ausitil for 125. The current queen of Dambrath is Yenandra; she is known there as the "Pirate Queen," for she has sailed as far south as Zakhara on pillaging raids. Yenandra has been ruling for 71 years and is beginning to show signs of age. She has three daughters as well, named Luatharyn, Meltruil, and Hasafir. While she does remain extremely popular, especially to the Crintri, the children of leaders in this land are not known to patiently wait their turn.~
@7307  = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings:

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the Realms. Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation. Throughout the centuries, the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn. In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature. A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer and greatest competitor. Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion. The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Estagund. The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.~

@7308  = ~History of Halruaa:

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert. The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netherese, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe. It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow. The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries, Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times. Once, led by a magic-resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa. They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader. Forty thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by five hundred Halruaans. More than two hundred Halruaan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle.

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than one hundred years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power-hungry king of Lapaliiya. He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruaans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships. The attackers were easily routed.

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netherese didn't approve of. The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa.

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruaans very defensive, warlike, and traditional. The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.~
@7309  = ~History of the North - Recent History of the North:

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows.

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel—and they'd told the king that he'd be disposed by other orcs.

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, as Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival."

For four months, the 40,000 orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls—never too good to begin with—created losses of their own.

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn.

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the extraordinary prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould.

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness.

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.~
@7310  = ~History of the North - The Elven Exodus:

This era left behind elven strongholds ripe for pillaging by humans and orcs. When elves chose to leave the North and travel to Evermeet, their works quickly disappeared, leaving only places like the Old Road and a ruined port in the High Forest to mark Eaerlann's passing. And yet it was not only the elves who would disappear from their long-held homes; the human nation of Netheril also stood on the brink of history.

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fill its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states that when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began three thousand years ago and reached its conclusion fifteen hundred years later.

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has there been such an outpouring of orcs. Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught and, with the aid of the treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more.

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.~
@7311  = ~History of the North - The Spread of Humankind:

The adaptable humans made use of magic they could seize or learn from the Proud Peoples to defeat all enemies, breaking (for a time) the power of giants and orcs. Waterdeep was founded. The last of the pureblood elves died out, a result of continued marriages with humans.

In the far west, men also dwelled—wise, clever primitives called the Ice Hunters. They lived simple lives on the coast since time beyond reckoning, countless generations before Netheril's first founders set foot on the Narrow Sea's western shore. Yet this peaceful folk fell prey to another invasion from the south: crude longships that carried a tall, fair-haired, warlike race who displaced the Ice Hunters from their ancestral lands.

This race, known as the Northmen, spread farms and villages along the coast from the banks of the Winding Water to the gorges of the Mirar. Northmen warriors drove the simple Ice Hunters farther and farther north, forced the goblinkin back into their mountain haunts, and instigated the last Council of Illefarn. Within five hundred years of the Northmen's arrival, Illefarn was no more—its residents had migrated to Evermeet.

From the Coast, Northmen sailed westward, claiming and establishing colonies on the major western islands of Ruathym and Gundarlun, eventually spreading to all the islands in the northern sea. Others migrated northward, past the Spine of the World, and became the truly savage barbarians of Icewind Dale.

In the centuries that followed, Ascalhorn became Hellgate Keep when it fell into the hands of fiends, and Eaerlann collapsed under the attack of a new orc horde. The elves fled southeast, joining with Northmen, Netherese descendants, and dwarves to form what would later be known as the Fallen Kingdom. This realm was short-lived and collapsed under the next orcish invasion—though in dying, it dealt the goblin races a blow from which they have yet to recover.~
@7312  = ~History of the North - The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost—until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city—this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerun, With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns; the seas swim with Northmen pirates; and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor—and support—pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and—most importantly—replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying seventeen wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~
@7313  = ~History of the North - 1368, Year of the Banner:

As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe. As the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible—as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem—to safety.

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale.

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail.

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog.

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city.~
@7314  = ~History of the North - 1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarfriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extra-planar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than 100 tanar'ri and other fiends as well as 500 members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extra-planar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission, Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than 100 miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest—including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists—battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell alongside his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed—and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Turnstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the Realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland." While it is unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around twenty fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home.~
@7315  = ~History of the North - Return of the Beast (1367-?):

Sages, philosophers, historians, and priests alike feel an ill-boding in the chill air. They predict a slow change over the next decade, but within the lifetime of men born on the first day of this age. They believe that the beasts that once ruled the land plan to return to claim what's rightfully theirs, imprisoning and enslaving the crowns. Where elves once reigned, men now rule, but their hold—as true for all civilizations before—is tenuous at best.~
@7316  = ~History of the North - 137O, Year of the Tankard:

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man.

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, easy to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.~
@7317  = ~History of Waterdeep:

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the Realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over twenty black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city.~
@7318  = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea. Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago. In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara. This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba. These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia). In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar. It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted. According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves. As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods. People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others. Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center. These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Dalelands territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands. They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations. Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base. This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales. A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale. During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep. More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~
@7319  = ~History of Cormyr:

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line.

The land has been officially at peace for many years—since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel, to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands, and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east. One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy." In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.~
@7320  = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding. However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves who feared the loss of their entire wood. This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR). This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today). It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands. Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them. Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace," and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads. At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches. The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court and asked the elders of their Council to approve a road open to humans linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown). Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur. The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement. However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate. If the road was built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished. The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree. The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves. Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt). Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms. Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared. None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~
@7321  = ~History of the Moonsea:

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes. The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar.

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North—including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands—who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic. In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region.

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning. Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants. Phlan has fallen and risen again. Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town. Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks. Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt.

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea. The greatest cities—Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep—are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips. The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature. In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality.~
@7322  = ~History of the Vast:

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr.

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only forty years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The orcs overran the dwarves, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast.

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth.~
@7323  = ~History of the Dragon Coast:

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin. Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day.

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall. It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south. And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power.

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate. The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords. His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast—corruption and treachery.

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR. Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated.~
@7324  = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times, these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked—Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land—freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~
@7325  = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth:

Much confusion exists in the Realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim. The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood. In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea. It is one of the most evil cities in the Realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices. Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales. The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale.

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch). Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership. The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts. Their rulership has spread with the passing years. In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes. Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas.

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep. Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.~
@7326  = ~History of Ulgarth:

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power. When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism. Warchiefs united the country several times during this period. They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden. In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth. There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land. They settled down, and began raising children and crops. This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace. But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits. The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants. In 1002 DR, the centuries long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power. There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other. With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations. Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world. In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth. Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade. The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued on his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.~
@7327  = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "elves of the south," before this crucial event. Even then they were known as "dark elves," for the hue of their skins. They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South. A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes. Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them.

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered. This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~
@7328  = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars:

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during the Descent. In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark. They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items, and using them against the dwarves—establishing an enmity that is still strong today.

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm. This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden. The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities. The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as the Great Rift. The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize, and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell. "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.~
@7329  = ~History of Waterdeep - Age 0, Trademoots and Pioneers:

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing, hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs with the merchants' jewelry and metal tools, or the occasionally-available weapon or two, with vessels sailing in from the south. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, or a rocky island beyond it.~
@7330  = ~History of Waterdeep - Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings, After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors. Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed.~
@7331  = ~History of Waterdeep - Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council, The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the peoples' consent, but the Guildmasters said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must always have been golems or zombies controlled by Ahghairon himself, to conceal his lone rule, and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, ofttimes termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two—ruthless manipulators both—were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~
@7332  = ~History of Waterdeep - Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins:

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few—in secret—to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished.

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords, Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the Realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money—and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith, Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity, Twice more the city walls were expanded, and its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came.

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).~
@7333  = ~History of Waterdeep - Age IV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before—save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the Realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North.~
@7334  = ~History of the Unicorn Run:

Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life and a cradle of fecundity. Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world. Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity. As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.~
@7335  = ~History of the Dead Three: 'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE'

In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well. Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal wielded. The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the Realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually the trio destroyed one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves.

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest: the Bone Throne.

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant. "I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. "And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer.

Jergal arose form his throne with a weary expression and said, "The Throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position." Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued, "Who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened. "After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal.

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed. Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened. "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule, Lord Bane, will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him.

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.~
@7336  = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerun, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion. The powers then dropped a star onto the land. The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars. Slowly picking up speed, the gall rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks. The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths. The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemminglike, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future. They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~
@7337  = ~History of the Sisters of Light and Darkness:

This was the birth of the world and the heavens. After Lord Ao created Realmspace, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows before light and dark were separate entities. Within this dim chaos stalked 13 lords of shadow, the Shadevari—whether they came from elsewhere or are children of the shadow itself, none can say.

Eventually this primordial essence coalesced into twin beautiful goddesses who were yin and yang to each other; they were so close they thought of themselves as one being. The Two-Faced Goddess created the heavenly bodies of the crystal sphere and together infused them with life to form the Earthmother, Chauntea. (Although Chauntea has since contracted her essence to encompass only Abeir-Toril, in the beginning she embodied all matter in Realmspace.) This new universe was lit by the face of the silver-haired goddess, who called herself Selune, and darkened by the welcoming tresses of the raven-haired goddess, Shar, but no heat or fire existed within it.

Chauntea begged for warmth so that she could nurture life and living creatures upon the planets that were her body and limbs, and the two sisters-Who-Were-One become divided, as for the first time they were of two minds. Silvery Selune contested with her dark sister over whether or not to bring further life to the worlds. During this great conflagration, the gods of war, disease, murder, and death, among others, were created from residues of the deific battle. At one point during the battle, Selune seized the advantage and reached across time and space to a land of eternal fire. Fighting the pain of the blaze, which burned her sorely, she broke off a fragment of that ever-living flame and ignited one of the heavenly bodies so that it burned in the sky and warmed Chauntea.

Incensed, Shar redoubled her attack on her injured twin and began to snuff out all light and heat throughout the crystal sphere. Again Selune gave of herself and tore the divine essence of magic from her body, flinging it desperately at her sister in defense of life in the sphere. This essence entered Shar, ripped an equal portion of energy from her, and reformed behind her as the goddess of magic, known now as Mystra, but then as Mystryl. Though Mystryl was composed of both light and dark magic, she favored her first mother Selune initially, allowing the silver goddess to win an uneasy truce with her more powerful, dark twin. Consumed by bitterness at her defeat, Shar vowed eternal revenge.

The twin goddesses contested for eons as life struggled into existence on Toril and the other planets under Chauntea's watchful gaze. Shar remained powerful, but bitterly alone, while Selune waxed and waned in power, often drawing strength from her allied Daughters and sons and like-minded immigrant deities. Over time, Shar grew strong again, aided by the shadevari who preferred night to blinding light and who stalked the Realms seeking to meld light and dark into shadowy chaos once again. Shar's plot to reform the world after her own desires was undone when Azuth, the High One, formerly the greatest of all mortal spellcasters and now consort to Mystra (incarnate successor to Mystryl), found a way to imprison the shadevari in a pocket-sized crystal sphere located beyond the edges of the world by creating the illusion of a realm of shadows. The Lords of Shadow were drawn to investigate, and before they discovered the trick, Azuth imprisoned the shadevari with the Shadowstar, a key of shadows forged by Gond. The High Lord then hurled the key into the endless reaches of the cosmos allowing life to flourish on in Chauntea's loving hands.~
@7338  = ~History of the Valley of the Gods:

It is said that even the powers must cavort and amuse themselves once in a great while. Far to the north of the Spine of the World is the Valley of the Gods. A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is not meant for mortals. Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley. Far too many mortals with delusions of grandeur have thrown away the pleasures of this side of the Spine and their kingdoms in this world, only to break their backs searching for the legendary Valley of the Gods.~
@7339  = ~History of the Fateful Coin:

Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life. When each newborn baby enters into the Realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche. Beshaba calls it in the air—the moon (heads) or the cloak (tails). If Beshaba is right, that person is cursed with misfortune for the rest of his or her days. If she's wrong, Lady Luck smiles on that child for the rest of his or her life. For some rare beings, the coin lands edge on—and these luckless few can forge their own fates, for they have more freedom over their destinies than the powers themselves.~
@7340  = ~Battle Axe +2: "Battleaxe of Mauletar"
During the Tethyr civil war, the Battleaxe of Mauletar was in the possession of the house of Ossyind. This noble family was betrayed while trying to flee the country, and Mauletar, lead guard and personal friend, took up the axe and sacrificed himself to buy enough time for his companions to flee. His battle cry was favored by the gods, and was echoed across the lands as a symbol of devoted friendship and loyalty. Thus, the magical axe was used to uphold these virtues, to be used against those who lacked honor and courage.~
@7341  = ~Dagger +2: "Heart of the Golem"
There are no records of this weapon's creator; nevertheless, its existence can be traced back among thieves and murderers to before Dalereckoning. Its blackened blade was apparently forged from the arcane metals of an iron golem, giving the weapon an appearance as dark as its history.

Suryris, a white minotaur who traveled the Orsraun mountains in Turmish, lived for nothing but the thrill of combat, and encouraged warriors to challenge him for his magical weapon: a powerful halberd. Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower. Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat. The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryis knew he likely would have been bested had it continued. He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.

Its namesake was the original owner of the weapon, and his tale, though mostly long forgotten, was wrought with treachery and deceit. Rumors persist that he paid a fearsome price for this blade, but with it he revealed the true identities of those that sought to betray him. Their names and crimes however, are long since lost to history.

Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies. Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power. In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form. Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated that she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

@7347  = ~Short Sword +2: "The Whistling Sword"
Amidst the plains of the Eastern Shaar there lived a small human blacksmith, whose nearly dwarven height did not do his soul justice. Though a skilled weaponsmith, his true gift was his ability to whistle a heartfelt song that could cause a grown man to cry like a newborn. Only a reclusive mage shared and enjoyed time with the diminutive man, however, as others could only see his small size as a source of amusement. Deaf to the smith's song because of their own prejudices, their ridicule slowly grew into cruel torment which eventually persuaded the light-hearted man to leave his home forever. Before he left he forged this weapon as a gift for his one friend, who also enchanted it during the making. Thus the blade sweetly whistles to its wielder when unsheathed. It was not long after that the mage also deserted the small town in disgust, taking the sword with him on his journeys.

Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon. He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloat in his advantage. The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.

This amulet was carried into deep dungeons within the Thunder Peaks nearly six hundred years ago. Mistakenly overestimating the power of this item, the owner foolishly ventured too far and met his end there. How the amulet was removed from the dark caverns is shrouded in mystery, as is the identity of the individual who found it.~
@7374  = ~Amulet of Metaspell Influence: "The Amplifier"
Known for its ability to enhance spellcasting, the Amulet of Metaspell Influence is highly sought after by magic practitioners. It was created by Elairdrin Mellwith, who resided in the Star Mountains. His reasons for fabricating such an item stemmed from his womanizing habits, and to this extent, the Amplifier served his purpose well. It was later taken from him by a mage with a more destructive intent, but records detailing the change of hands vary widely.

@7375  = ~Boots of Speed: "The Paws of the Cheetah"
These enchanted boots were once the property of a deadly assassin fond of chasing down his prey. He moved with such speed that his targets often didn't have the opportunity to respond, even on horseback. Over time the assassin's fame spread, and though his name was never known, all knew to fear the words last heard by his victims: "You can hide, but you cannot run!"~
@7376  = ~Boots of Stealth: "Worn Whispers"
In ages past, a king named Rhigaerd was renowned for the spies he kept. So skillful were they, that no nook or cranny escaped their eyes and maps were held for entire castles and towns. Eventually betrayed from within, the tools of their trade were taken and dispersed, ensuring that none could amass such a band again.

@7377  = ~Boots of the North: "The Frost's Embrace"
Stranded by his company for a sack of gold, Daviol the Frozen was left for dead in the midst of the Great Glacier. His dying curse echoed across the barren wastelands to the ear of Auril, goddess of winter. She smiled upon him, and his bare body was protected and preserved by his newly enchanted boots of the north. With them he crossed the ice land in pursuit of his would-be murderers. Driven by rage, Daviol took his revenge upon his previous friends as they warmed themselves in a tavern of the closest city. After his thirst for blood was quenched, he continued to travel the frozen land, never to be seen again.

@7378  = ~Boots of Avoidance: "Senses of the Cat"
The magic of these boots was specifically designed to detect incoming missiles and aid the wearer in avoiding them. They were originally commissioned by the instructor of an archery academy, who had tired of suffering "accidents" at the hands of his inexperienced students.

@7379  = ~Boots of Grounding: "Talos' Gift"
Untold years ago, the Fortress of the Starspire Peninsula was placed under the direct torment of Talos when a favored Stormherald was murdered there. Talos promised the destruction of the city by earthquakes, its isolation by tidal waves, and the death of its citizens by storms. One pair of these boots was bestowed to ensure that none but a single man would survive to tell the story of his wrath. Later, travelers seeking fortune in the ruined city came upon an aged man, maddened by the continuous destruction around him; the boots he wore would carry to many a distant land the legend of a city consumed by a god's rage.

@7380  = ~Bracers of Defense AC 6: "Bracers to the Death"
These bracers were held for decades by an undefeated gladiator, and found extensive use in arena combat. The death of this champion marked the disappearance of this magical item, but rumors persist that they are used to this day in competitive combat across the lands.

@7381  = ~Bracers of Archery: "The Dale's Protector"
During a dangerous meeting with a rival ruler, the king of the Great Dale requested the protection of his best archers in addition to his usual guard. The archers, each equipped with an enchanted bow and bracers, hid within range of the gathering. As predicted, enemy troops attempted to seize the king and force their will over his rule, but none had anticipated the amazing accuracy and lethality of the hidden archers. The king was able to escape unharmed; in fact, none of the ambush members even lived to approach him.

@7385  = ~Gauntlets of Weapon Skill: "Xarrnous' Second Sword Arm"
Perhaps the most well-known owner of these gauntlets was a mercenary, named Xarrnous. He specialized in smuggling and frequently loaned these gauntlets to clients if they were to travel with him. In his eyes, an extra sword arm was always handy.

@7386  = ~Gauntlets of Weapon Expertise: "Legacy of the Masters"
Highly sought after among novice warriors, these items were once the property of the royal family of Threskel. Imparting a portion of the prince's legendary skill, these gauntlets grant the bearer mastery over all forms of melee weapons. The majority of their many previous owners seem to have come to bloody ends though; the gloves grant the ability of experience, but not the wisdom.

@7388  = ~Cloak of the Wolf: "Relair's Mistake"
A great amount of irony surrounds the creation of this magical cloak. Relair was a mage who overestimated the amount of control he had over magic, and in the course of creating this garment, he apparently inflicted lycanthropy upon himself. The wearer can change form whenever their wish. Relair was not so lucky.

@7392  = ~Girdle of Blades: "The Protector of the Unworthy"
The most infamous owner of this item forever tainted its reputation, though it is still a truly useful item. Morinden of the Wicked Heart made his living looting the bodies of those he slew. He would goad true warriors into duels of honor (though he had little knowledge of the subject) and laugh as their blades glanced off him. Eventually he met his end at the hands of a frustrated woodsman, who had wisely cast his sword aside in favor of a tree stump.~
@7393  = ~Girdle of Piercing: "Elves' Bane"
An infamous highwayman in his day, Pandar of Scardale made quite a name for himself vexing the elves of Cormanthor forest. To their annoyance, he continually used the wood to escape the law; and with the aid of this girdle, the elves' arrows as well. Unfortunately for Pandar, pit traps and starvation proved a slower, but effective, substitution.

Having lost friends and loved ones to a series of raids by hill giants, Garrar the Powerful made it his mission to cleanse his homeland of their presence. It is not known where he acquired this item, but with it he single-handedly dispatched dozens of the creatures, all the while protected from the blows of their clubs. The remaining giants fled to neighboring lands—those that lacked a similar champion and did not fare as well.

Named for its original owner, Sir Tain the Noble, this helm saw many great battles in his possession. It was eventually passed on to Sir Tain's squire, who had served him faithfully for almost ten years. Alas, the young man had neither the strength nor the skill to uphold his master's legacy. It is rumored he lost his life in the pursuit of a worthy, but ultimately futile cause, and the helm has had many owners since.

Prized for its noble origin as much as for its benefits to the wearer, this helm was originally intended to be a simple gift. There was no great crisis at hand, nor dangerous evil to be overthrown; just a wish for a friend to give a gift to another. It could just have easily been a good book or bottle of wine, but adventurers are eminently more practical in their gift giving. The helm has seen many great battles since its creation, but the simple virtue at its core is what has always been remembered.

@7552  = ~I'm glad to hear it.~
@7553  = ~Just to be polite.~
@7554  = ~Could you all be dears, and go away. I don't mean to be rude, but a conversation with the lot of you doesn't excite my interest.~
@7555  = ~Hello again. So how goes your mercenary gig?~
@7556  = ~That's good to hear. Goodbye now.~
@7557  = ~Oh, I feel for you. Goodbye now.~
@7558  = ~Really! How very exciting. I just wonder at what you save them from. I would offer my assistance, but I'm terribly busy. I hope your heroics go well. While you're at it, I've heard there's a princess in the north tower who needs rescuing as well.~
@7559  = ~I must ask that you don't bother me. It is difficult to concentrate on my music with the likes of you about.~
@7560  = ~Don't try to patronize us, you traitorous wench.~
@7561  = ~We're fine, no thanks to you.~
@7562  = ~Why do you even bother asking?~

@7567  = ~A princess?! Tell us more.~
@7568  = ~Shut up, Silke.~
@7569  = ~I was being sarcastic, you moron.~
@7570  = ~All right folks, if you wanna enjoy the pleasures of the Undercellar, you'll have to pay the 10 gold entrance fee. Then all the black lotus and women you want is yours for the night.~
@7571  = ~Sorry, no money, no entry.~
@7572  = ~I'm not gonna lower anything. Now hand over the money.~
@7573  = ~Droth~
@7574  = ~Get outta my face.~
@7575  = ~We just want to take a look around.~
@7576  = ~Okay, here's your money.~
@7577  = ~The price is kind of steep. Perhaps you could lower it a bit?~
@7578  = ~No thanks, we'll be leaving now.~
@7579  = ~Okay, here's your damn money.~
@7580  = ~Fine. We'll be leaving now.~

@7587  = ~Just a word of warning to a friend: watch for those two crazies, Slythe and Krystin. They're not with it, if you know what I mean.~
@7588  = ~Hey, no one's supposed to be down here. State your business, 'fore I have to give you the beats.~
@7589  = ~I wasn't told, and I think ye're lying.~
@7590  = ~Okay, carry on then.~
@7591  = ~Lying scum! There aren't any new recruits.~

@7599  = ~Hey, buddy, take as long as you want down here. It's all been rather lax since the two bosses left.~
@7600  = ~Welcome to the Iron Throne citadel. Could you please state what business brings you here?~
@7601  = ~Hmmm. I think 100 gold would persuade us to let you in. Just make sure not to make any trouble.~
@7602  = ~We don't take bribes! Now get out before we thrash you.~
@7603  = ~We're not going to step aside for what is obviously a troupe of brigands. Get out of here before we summon the Flaming Fist.~
@7604  = ~Strange... We've not been told about you, but no matter, you may come in.~
@7605  = ~We don't need any new employees. Now get lost.~
@7606  = ~New employees, huh? Well, take yourselves up to the fourth floor; there you'll find some private offices. The men in those offices do all the hiring.~

@7618  = ~You there! What are you doing here? I don't recognize you.~
@7619  = ~We're looking the other way. Now get out of here.~
@7620  = ~Sure, we'll take your money... from your cooling corpse that is.~
@7621  = ~All you are is a dead liar.~
@7622  = ~Okay, sorry for troubling you.~
@7623  = ~We've got no new recruits. What I think you are is a spy.~
@7624  = ~Get a move on then, and put your uniforms on.~
@7625  = ~That's funny, 'cause last I heard, the Iron Throne was banned from operating in Cormyr. Lying scum! I don't know how you've gotten this far, but you'll get no further.~
@7626  = ~How about you just take this 100 gold and look the other way?~
@7627  = ~How about you just take this 100 gold and look the other way?~

@7631  = ~Calm down; we're new recruits. We just haven't got our uniforms yet.~
@7632  = ~We've just come from Cormyr. With business going so well there, we have brought a large sum of surplus money for your superiors. I'm sure they wouldn't wish to be kept waiting.~
@7633  = ~If ye're lookin' to talk with some of the high-ups, you should visit the fourth floor.~
@7634  = ~You there. This is MY kitchen, and I don't like interlopers, so get out!~
@7635  = ~Didn't I tell you to get out? I don't want you in my kitchen, can't you get that through yer thick skull?~
@7636  = ~It's you again. By the claws of Umberlee, I can't take these interruptions much longer. Get out of my kitchen, and stay out.~
@7637  = ~I'm just a cook, what should I know?~
@7638  = ~I must apologize for me fella here, John. He just gets irate real easy. You'd do best to avoid him when he's in these kinda moods.~
@7639  = ~Sorry, no food fer ya right now.~
@7640  = ~I'm just a cook, what should I know?~
@7641  = ~Hey there, mate. Don't recognize you, which is strange, considering I know everyone here at the Iron Throne. Why don't you tell me who you are?~
@7642  = ~Out of Sembia, eh? Well, if ye're looking for Rieltar or Brunos, you won't find them here. They're off to Candlekeep for some important business.~
@7643  = ~From Cormyr? That's strange; I didn't think that the Iron Throne had any business dealing in Cormyr. After King Azoun banned them from the country that is.~
@7644  = ~Oh, I see. Well, if ye're wondering where you'll be assigned, I'd bet it would be with the Blacktalons down in the Wood of Sharp Teeth. They've lost quite a few members lately and are in desperate need of new recruits.~
@7645  = ~It certainly is my business, and I don't think you belong here. INTRUDERS! We have intruders in the tower!~
@7646  = ~The Throne was dealing in black lotus, slaves, prostitution—all the vices that King Azoun had a real dislike for. Since the king has the power to do whatever he wants, he banned the Throne from Cormyr. It was a good thing too, otherwise the Throne would have never given Rieltar the funds he needed to start up this operation on the Sword Coast.~
@7647  = ~Hmmm, I don't see what that has to do with Rieltar, but I'll take your word for it.~
@7648  = ~We're merchants just out of Sembia.~
@7649  = ~We're merchants just out of Cormyr.~
@7650  = ~We're new recruits. We haven't been given an assignment yet.~
@7651  = ~None of your business.~
@7652  = ~So why did the Iron Throne get banned from Cormyr?~
@7653  = ~Yes, well the Iron Throne wants to renew some of its ties to Cormyr.~
@7654  = ~What are the likes of you doing in the dining chambers? Dismiss yourselves immediately before I have you thrown out.~
@7655  = ~I don't understand why you insist on smelling up the room. All of you should go and bathe.~
@7656  = ~Stop bothering me, you ill-mannered lout.~
@7657  = ~Good friend, why don't you take these 25 gold pieces and run along? Have some fun.~
@7658  = ~Ahhh look, some newcomers. I assume that the lot of you has just arrived with new supplies from Ordulin. If you're looking for Rieltar or Brunos, look no further. Both of them have traveled to Candlekeep on important business.~
@7659  = ~Could you please stop bothering me?~
@7660  = ~If you need someone to speak with, talk to Larnos in the side room.~
@7661  = ~Good friend, why don't you take these 25 gold pieces and run along? Have some fun.~
@7662  = ~So, what can I help you with?~
@7663  = ~I apologize. Someone has made a mistake; we are hiring no one at the moment. I hope there hasn't been too much inconvenience, but could you please leave now?~
@7664  = ~And why would you be looking for them? Might I ask you who you are and what you're doing here?~
@7665  = ~Well, Rieltar isn't here right now. I'd suggest you find an inn and wait for his return from Candlekeep.~
@7666  = ~From Cormyr? That is most interesting, considering that the Iron Throne is banned from operating there. What I really think is that you're spies. GUARDS!~
@7667  = ~Wait! Don't kill me please! What do you want to know? I'll tell you anything.~
@7668  = ~They—they're at Candlekeep, at some important conference.~
@7669  = ~I couldn't tell you that. I'm not privy to that kind of information. You-you'd have to ask Rieltar, Brunos, or Thaldorn.~
@7670  = ~It's located on the fifth floor.~
@7671  = ~Please leave; I promise not to tell anyone you're here.~
@7672  = ~We were sent here with the understanding that you did all of the hiring for the Iron Throne.~
@7673  = ~We're looking for the leaders of the Iron Throne.~
@7674  = ~We're the mercenaries who've been messing up all your operations these past weeks. Tell us everything you know or we'll kill you where you stand!~
@7675  = ~We're merchants in from Sembia. We have important news for your leader.~
@7676  = ~We're merchants. We have just arrived from Cormyr, and have important news for your leader.~
@7677  = ~We're mercenaries looking for a job. We were told that you were the person to talk to.~
@7678  = ~Where are your leaders?~
@7679  = ~What are the Iron Throne's plans?~
@7680  = ~Where are the offices of your leader?~
@7681  = ~Do you mind? I'm a very busy man, and I don't need these constant interruptions.~
@7682  = ~When we threatened one of the Iron Throne merchants, he told us that his leaders were at Candlekeep.~
@7683  = ~When we threatened one of the Iron Throne merchants, he told us that his leaders were at Candlekeep.~
@7684  = ~The offices of the Iron Throne leaders are on the fifth floor of the building.~
@7685  = ~If you're looking for Rieltar and Brunos, you'd find them at Candlekeep. There's some sort of clandestine rendezvous at the library.~
@7686  = ~A charmed merchant told us that the leaders of the Iron Throne were at Candlekeep.~
@7687  = ~You're Aldeth's childhood friends, aren't you? You know, if I were you, I'd be careful around here.~
@7688  = ~Irlentree and Zorl have been acting strange of late. I don't know what it is about them, but they don't seem to be their usual selves.~
@7689  = ~If you search Zorl's office on the second floor, you might turn something up.~
@7690  = ~You mistook my meaning; it wasn't a threat. Now, please leave me alone.~
@7691  = ~Please don't bother me, I have a lot on my mind.~
@7692  = ~Angelo~
@7693  = ~Anything I can help you with? Oh yes, you're those friends of Aldeth's. I'd love to get to know you better, but I'm awfully busy.~
@7694  = ~Okay, we'll be sure to.~
@7695  = ~Is there a reason why we should?~
@7696  = ~I hope that wasn't a threat.~
@7697  = ~If the truth be known, Aldeth hired us to investigate his partners. Is there anything you know that could help us?~
@7698  = ~Thank you for the information.~
@7699  = ~Things have been very unusual lately. Zorl and Irlentree, two of the owners, have not been acting properly in mercantile matters. If they continue with the direction they've been taking, our company will be sunk within the month.~
@7700  = ~One of the merchants at the Merchants' League Estate told us to investigate Zorl's office on the second floor.~
@7701  = ~Feeling somewhat sheepish after treating him so poorly, I have agreed to retrieve the sword of poor Perdue the halfling from a band of gnolls apparently lurking in the plains west of Beregost, close to the High Hedge.~
@7702  = ~Be'land~
@7703  = ~Greetings, <SIRMAAM>. I hope your stay at the Merchants' League Estate is profitable.~
@7704  = ~Hello, <SIRMAAM>. If I'm not being too forward, might I suggest something?~
@7705  = ~Yes, <SIRMAAM>!~
@7706  = ~If I've guessed correctly, you're here to investigate Zorl and Irlentree. I think you should contact my superior, Brandilar. He might be able to help you.~
@7707  = ~Nothing to see here, <SIRMAAM>!~
@7708  = ~Sure, continue.~
@7709  = ~Shut up, guard!~
@7710  = ~If I were you, friend, I'd go talk with Brandilar.~
@7711  = ~I don't recognize ya. Are you new to the Merchants' League? Well, it matters little, I don't have anything ta drink. My masters haven't ordered any new booze to replace our last stock. Kinda thoughtless of 'em, but then, they've been acting weird for a little while now.~
@7712  = ~Hey there, what can I do for ya?~
@7713  = ~Ya. As the harbormaster I'm privy to a lot of what's going on. What's it that ya want ta know?~
@7714  = ~The iron shortage, eh? Well, there's not much to tell. With the Nashkel mines basically shut down, and bandits making it impossible to ship overland, iron's become rare. Recently though, the Iron Throne's been shipping in iron through their merchant fleet. It's really strange, 'cause their main competitors aren't doing the same. They're just lettin' the Throne hog the whole market.~
@7715  = ~The Iron Throne's been making some major moves in the city. They've been making inroads in all sorts of markets, though the most noticeable would be iron. Their competitors just sit there and take it. It's really weird.~
@7716  = ~I'm not here to entertain people. I'm gonna have to ask ya to leave so I can get some work done now.~
@7717  = ~Nice talkin' to ya guys.~
@7718  = ~Ya wanna charter a ship, do ya? Well, where is it that ya wanna go?~
@7719  = ~Usually there's a ship going to Waterdeep every couple days, but with all the troubles in the Sea of Swords, travel's kinda dropped off. It'll be a couple weeks 'fore something comes in.~
@7720  = ~No ships headed there at the moment. If one comes in, I'll tell the captain someone's interested.~
@7721  = ~By the Bitch Queen's breath! That's Duke Eltan ya have with you. He's looking in a bad way. Leave him here with me; I'll make sure he's all right. You're the people who've been working fer Scar and Eltan against the Iron Throne. Well, I'm sure you have much to do, so you should a get a move on it. Don't worry about Eltan, I'll keep good care of him. I've got to get him to a safe place, so good luck.~
@7722  = ~We've been investigating some of the weird goings-on of Baldur's Gate, and we thought that the harbormaster must know a great deal, what with the comings and goings of the merchant ships.~
@7723  = ~We wanted to charter a ship.~
@7724  = ~We're sorry to have bothered you.~
@7725  = ~We've been investigating some of the weird goings-on of Baldur's Gate, and we thought that the harbormaster must know a great deal, what with the comings and goings of the merchant ships.~
@7726  = ~Tell us what you know about the iron shortage.~
@7727  = ~Do you know much about the Iron Throne?~
@7728  = ~Tell us whatever you might think is interesting.~
@7729  = ~Actually, we have to get going.~
@7730  = ~Waterdeep would be a fine destination.~
@7731  = ~I've always wanted to see Calimport.~
@7732  = ~The Moonshae Isles.~
@7733  = ~I'm really busy now, so I'm gonna have to ask ya ta come back some time later.~
@7734  = ~You guys shouldn't be hanging 'round here. Ya might bring attention to Duke Eltan.~
@7735  = ~Well, friend, ya might be interested ta know that there's been quite a few Iron Throne ships coming to dock these past few weeks. They've been stockpiling something, and if I guess right, that something is iron.~
@7736  = ~When we charmed the harbormaster, he told us that there were quite a few Iron Throne merchant ships coming into port these past few weeks. He thinks they were bringing in iron.~
@7737  = ~When we charmed the harbormaster, he told us that there were quite a few Iron Throne merchant ships coming into port these past few weeks. He thinks that the ships were carrying iron.~
@7738  = ~According to the harbormaster, the Iron Throne has been shipping iron into the city via its merchant fleet.~
@7739  = ~Who're you?! I've been expectin' Sarevok, not some ragtag band.~
@7740  = ~Trying to lie to me, are you?! You're that <CHARNAME>, ain't ya? Don't know how you got out of the prison, don't much care either. You're trying to mess up Sarevok's plans. Well, don't count on succeeding. There's no way ye're getting by me or my boys. Don't think Sarevok would take too kindly if you showed up to mess with his plans for Baldur's Gate. Come on, boys, let's make short work of 'em.~
@7741  = ~I thought as much! You won't get by me and my band without a fight!~
@7742  = ~It sure is my business. You won't be getting by me and my band! Come on, boys, let's toast these ninnies!~
@7743  = ~We're other members of Sarevok's band. We were sent to help you.~
@7744  = ~We're the mercenaries who've been causing the Iron Throne so much hurt!~
@7745  = ~None of your business. Now, out of our way!~
@7746  = ~I'm working for a man named Sarevok. He hasn't told me much about all his schemes, but I know he has it in big for you. I helped him frame you for the murders up there in the library. It was a party of doppelgangers that did the deed; they took your forms and then slaughtered those unsuspecting bastards. Nothing much I can do ta help you, but if you want my advice, I'd lay low for a while.~
@7747  = ~Sarevok framed us for the murders of Rieltar and Brunos. He had a group of doppelgangers assume our forms and murder the Iron Throne leaders.~
@7748  = ~Well, hello there, young one! Come to visit your old pal Winthrop, have ye? Well, don't forget the 5,000 gp book entrance fee, as per Candlekeep custom, don'tcha know.~
@7749  = ~Ever the humorless brat ye always were! It's but for the reputation of your father that I give ye endless chances to redeem yer manner. I will tolerate ye here today, but bother me not.~
@7750  = ~Haw! Just having a bit o' fun with ye, my friend. Them monks may be walking about with poles in their nethers, but you know you are always welcome here in my sight. Gorion did well by you, he did. So, is there anything I can do for ya? Some drinks, a room to sleep, or anything to buy?~
@7751  = ~A charming child ye always were, but I fear ye lack the sense of humor your father and I shared. You must know that you are welcome here always. Stay as you will as long as ye like. So, is there anything I can do for ya? Some drinks, a room to sleep, or anything to buy?~
@7752  = ~I fear ye have spent too much time around those stiff-necked monks and mistaken my attempt at humor for a serious demand. Perish the thought that I should charge for your company. Any child of Gorion is more than welcome in my inn. So, is there anything I can do for ya? Some drinks, a room to sleep, or anything to buy?~
@7753  = ~I shall take no offense because of your esteemed parentage, but please refrain from making jest of me in my own home. Stay as you will, as long as you like. So, is there anything I can do for ya. Some drinks, a room to sleep, or anything to buy?~
@7754  = ~As good to see ye again as any other I could have laid eyes on. Make yourself as comfortable as you will. If you wish for anything, just ask.~
@7755  = ~It's good to see you well, young one. Drop by the Inn any time if ye need a short respite from the monotony of the library.~
@7756  = ~That is outrageous! What kind of a fool do you take me for?! Stuff your inn, and stuff your company!~
@7757  = ~That is outrageous! What kind of a fool do you take me for?! Stuff your inn, and stuff your company!~
@7758  = ~You always were the big kidder, Winthrop. That gets funnier very nearly every time I hear it. Well, perhaps not quite so often.~
@7759  = ~You always were the big kidder, Winthrop. That gets funnier very nearly every time I hear it. Well, perhaps not quite so often.~
@7760  = ~I fear I do not have that kind of entry fee with me. I suppose I shall return when I do.~
@7761  = ~I fear I do not have that kind of entry fee with me. I suppose I shall return when I do.~
@7762  = ~Step up to the heat, young one. You'll NEED a good fire to warm the chill stares of those monks. Most inhospitable, they are. Isn't that so, Lovey?~
@7763  = ~It's worth a try my dear, although our clothes may only be the half of it. They certainly couldn't react any worse than they have. I thank you for the suggestion, <CHARNAME>, and for putting it tactfully. Good eve to you.~
@7764  = ~I am quite sure we meant no insult. 'Tis just that we have come a long way to be treated in such an unwelcome manner. I would think the value of the entrance fee should buy you a touch more than a night at the Inn and a glaring stare as you flip through the odd tome.~
@7765  = ~Indeed, Lovey. You may have lived here, <CHARNAME>, but from your tone I wager you've forgotten much of the tact they should have taught. Leave us please.~
@7766  = ~I shouldn't answer that, Lovey. Seems as though this scoundrel might be trying to get a bit too familiar. Sizing up the potential loot, I should think. Best that you move along, lest the local constabulary gets involved.~
@7767  = ~A capital idea, Lovey. Perhaps I should do the same? Leave the finery under lock and key whilst we brush up on our reading? I can think of no safer a place than here. I doubt very much that a scoundrel would pay the book fee into this place to burgle the Inn. Laughable!~
@7768  = ~Perhaps. But if they wish no one to enter it is a simple matter of not letting anyone enter at all. 'Twould certainly be a shame if they did, though. Such a storehouse of knowledge has limited use if no one can use the stored knowledge. Ah, well. 'Tis cozy enough here by the fire to wash away any troubles I otherwise have with the place.~
@7769  = ~Oh yes, darling, they are MOST standoffish.~
@7770  = ~Colorful? Dear, perhaps we should dress a little more plainly to fit in?~
@7771  = ~Well! At least the monks were QUIET in their condemnation. Hrmph!~
@7772  = ~Perhaps that was it? It may have looked as though we were showing off. I'm going to lock all my jewelry back in the room dear, so I don't offend them again.~
@7773  = ~They lead a somewhat cloistered life here, so they are unaccustomed to many visitors. You are perhaps a bit... colorful compared to what they are used to.~
@7774  = ~Watch your tongue! This was my home for a good part of my life and I'll not have you slighting them in their own keep!~
@7775  = ~Watch your tongue! This was my home for a good part of my life and I'll not have you slighting them in their own keep!~
@7776  = ~Oh, I would not let it concern you, milady. Perhaps they are not used to wealth such as yours. You are quite wealthy, are you not? Bring a lot of expensive jewelry with you?~
@7777  = ~Oh, I would not let it concern you, milady. Perhaps they are not used to wealth such as yours. You are quite wealthy, are you not? Bring a lot of expensive jewelry with you?~
@7778  = ~Perhaps they have not been as welcoming as they could have, but you ARE strangers in their home.~
@7779  = ~Oh! Though I find you quite lovely, I don't think Thurston would really want me cavorting with strangers.~
@7780  = ~It is obvious what you need my good friend. Living in this library fortress must leave you with little in the way of monetary funds. Here, take this 20 gold; it is but a trifle to me, but I'm sure it'll put you on the right track.~
@7781  = ~What? I certainly hope there is an explanation for this intrusion! Explain yourself!~
@7782  = ~Ahem. Yes, well just don't let it happen again.~
@7783  = ~As well you should be, you common dolt! If it happens again I'll have you removed from the Inn!~
@7784  = ~What?! Well, I have NEVER been treated in such a manner. Begone! Lest I call the guard to remove you!~
@7785  = ~A-a-aye. Very straightforward indeed, but it is a flawed plan. If I should call out, the guard will hear and you are as good as dead. Now if you turn and leave this instant, perhaps I will let this go unreported.~
@7786  = ~You have returned?! Why do you not just attack the guard if you are in such a hurry to cause trouble? Leave at once lest I call out the alarm.~
@7787  = ~Um, I find it odd for you to have mistaken my room for yours yet again. Kindly leave.~
@7788  = ~My name is Quincy. Beyond that is my own business and none of your concern. Leave, lest I report this intrusion to the guard.~
@7789  = ~My apologies. I must have got the room numbers mixed about. Dreadfully sorry.~
@7790  = ~My apologies. I must have got the room numbers mixed about. Dreadfully sorry.~
@7791  = ~A simple mistake and no cause for excitement, so watch your words or I'll be forced to feed them to you!~
@7792  = ~Explain myself? You are some pompous noble and I am here to take your belongings. Straightforward enough?~
@7793  = ~Just getting to know the neighbors. Who might you be?~
@7794  = ~Well, now that we're friends, perhaps you may stay in my room for a little while.~
@7795  = ~Yes? Might I help you?~
@7796  = ~Perfectly understandable. Good eve to you.~
@7797  = ~I see. Well, please don't dawdle in the doorway all day. Best you were on your way.~
@7798  = ~Oh, indeed! Such a wondrous depository it is. I have returned on many an occasion, much to my banker's dismay, and have not even scratched the surface of the collection here. Would that it were so for all of my noble brethren. I fear many come to the keep merely to proclaim that they did. I suppose it makes them appear more intelligent, though simple quizzing places the majority of them securely about the chimp "level." I am sorry, I tend to ramble. Good eve to you.~
@7799  = ~Hmm, you look the sort to be in a fog generally. Are you certain this is a new obscuration, or are you simply confusing it with one you have carried over. Please leave me to my thoughts, and let not the door hit you on the hindquarters on your way out.~
@7800  = ~Can you really be so misguided as to attempt a boldfaced robbery on the grounds of the most closely guarded keep this side of Calimshan? You are truly daft indeed. Perhaps you should go back to your room and reflect on how dangerous a mistake you have almost made. Now.~
@7801  = ~I MIGHT very well be anyone, but I AM Christian of Waterdeep. Likely you would not know my family name or history, and this suits me well and good. These trips to Candlekeep are a bit of an extravagance on my part, and while I neither use illicit substances nor consort with "hired" company, I spend quite enough here that I should not like it common knowledge. To this end, I should appreciate it if you would forgo your odd little attempt at introductions and leave me to my thoughts.~
@7802  = ~You once again? I should appreciate it if you would remove your company until I sought it. Good day.~
@7803  = ~Sorry to have disturbed you. Wrong room, I fear.~
@7804  = ~Sorry to have disturbed you. Wrong room, I fear.~
@7805  = ~My apologies. I have been knee-deep in the tomes of the keep all day, and I am in quite the fog as a result.~
@7806  = ~My apologies. I have been knee-deep in the tomes of the keep all day, and I am in quite the fog as a result.~
@7807  = ~Yes indeed, you might help me to your valuables.~
@7808  = ~I was just wondering who else was sharing the inn with me tonight. Who might you be?~
@7809  = ~Not much happens here in Candlekeep, friend. I don't have any rumors for you on this day.~
@7810  = ~Hello hello hello. It's Bunsen's home you have entered, and welcome you are! Please, rest your somewhat less-than-hairy feet by my hearth.~
@7811  = ~You have been away from the small folk for some time if you have to ask that question. It is the highest of virtues to extend familial amenity to friends we have not met yet. You are welcome to stay as you wish, in the spirit of Cyrrollalee and all she stands for.~
@7812  = ~Such manners! I can think of no other in the history of this village to have insulted me so! As much as Cyrrollalee demands welcome hospitality, at least a small measure of gratitude is expected in return. You are not welcome in my burrow, and I think you will find the same is true among my neighbors if you continue to act as such.~
@7813  = ~Deserted? I think you will find that even if an owner were to stray from his hearth for years, friends and neighbors would keep his home warm and welcoming for his return. If a stranger felt the need to use it in the meantime, I could see no one with cause to object. No need for you to apologize. If my home seemed deserted, that simply means that I must strive all the more to present a welcoming friendly face. Cyrrollalee would settle for nothing less.~
@7814  = ~I wager you will not find a member of the small folk who locks their doors against visitors, known or not. It's common courtesy to extend welcome to whomever calls, regardless of their demeanor. You are welcome to stay a bit if you will, but it is rather late in the day.~
@7815  = ~If I possessed something you required, I doubt you would need but ask. Material goods are of little import to the small folk when compared to the value of a secure hearth. Such a rude presentation will get you naught but glares however. Do not tarry long in my home. You are not welcome.~
@7816  = ~Any insult from your entry is forgiven by your courtesy. The door is always open to friendly folk, regardless of their... parentage. Stay a while if you wish.~
@7817  = ~Hello again. A pleasure as it was before.~
@7818  = ~I see you have returned. I trust you will stay no longer than last we met?~
@7819  = ~Are you always this courteous to strangers that walk into your home? It hardly seems safe to me.~
@7820  = ~Are you always this courteous to strangers that walk into your home? It hardly seems safe to me.~
@7821  = ~Spare me your smiles, shorty. I merely came in to see if you had anything worth taking. You are foolish to leave your burrow unlocked.~
@7822  = ~Spare me your smiles, shorty. I merely came in to see if you had anything worth taking. You are foolish to leave your burrow unlocked.~
@7823  = ~My apologies, but the door was unlocked and I thought your burrow deserted. I did not mean to intrude upon your home.~
@7824  = ~My apologies, but the door was unlocked and I thought your burrow deserted. I did not mean to intrude upon your home.~
@7825  = ~Not much to tell friend. Most of my day is spent on my porch taking some puffs off the old pipe. Mayhaps you'd join me?~
@7826  = ~Well, friend, why don't you join me by the hearth? I have an extra pipe that you could use. I have a feeling though, that you adventuring types never have time for relaxation.~
@7827  = ~It's a quiet day and you have found me at home, strangers. Can I assist ye in any fashion?~
@7828  = ~That is only because the homes of our village are kept warm and inviting whether the owner is in or not. No need to apologize, you would be welcome regardless. Little to excite you wandering types here though, just a simple day spent by the hearth. It's all the treasure I seek or need.~
@7829  = ~I shall do no such thing. My meager possessions are but replaceable trinkets, but your manner is most distasteful. Likely you would get nothing but a polite request to leave if you approached any of my brethren in the same manner. I'll not show you the door, but it's only because you found it once already on your own.~
@7830  = ~Who would have the gall to steal from the small folk? None but the basest of villains, or rudest of fools. All others are welcome in hearth and home.~
@7831  = ~I cannot see how you would make that mistake, though I cannot understand many of the things that passes between the wanderers ears. Still, the spirit of Littleman is in all of you and you are welcome here for a while at least.~
@7832  = ~It's certainly a grievous mistake you have made in insulting my home and hearth with threats of thievery. Being the generous sort that I am I will give you the opportunity to leave. Return and it shall be as though we have never met, and hopefully the second time around shall be more enjoyable.~
@7833  = ~I think you will find that friendly but wary eyes take careful care to watch over the burrows of our village.~
@7834  = ~Again we meet. I do so enjoy our little chats.~
@7835  = ~Once again I find you in mine home. If you retain your manners you are welcome.~
@7836  = ~My apologies for disturbing your humble burrow, but I was unaware anyone was within.~
@7837  = ~My apologies for disturbing your humble burrow, but I was unaware anyone was within.~
@7838  = ~You can assist me to your valuables, and be quick about it!~
@7839  = ~You can assist me to your valuables, and be quick about it!~
@7840  = ~It is amazing how trusting you small folk are. With your door left open you are an easy mark for thieves.~
@7841  = ~It is amazing how trusting you small folk are. With your door left open you are an easy mark for thieves.~
@7842  = ~Well, friend, why don't you join me by the hearth? I have an extra pipe that you could use. I have a feeling though, that you adventuring types never have time for relaxation.~
@7843  = ~Oh, welcome to you. A pity my son is not here to meet you. It would be most exciting for him.~
@7844  = ~Oh, it is most exciting for any halfling to meet those with the spirit of Littleman in them. You might be a tad... eccentric for leaving the comforts of a well stocked hearth, but I'm sure your escapades are exhilarating... if you are into that sort of thing. Please come back anytime you wish.~
@7845  = ~It's an oddity among many of our young folk that they see the essence of the great wandered Littleman in the deeds of people like you. I personally see little appeal in leaving hearth and home. Stay as you will, but try not to encourage the children too much.~
@7846  = ~Hmph! And I should not like to see him exposed to such manners! It's certain you do not spend much time amongst the small folk. None who knew our ways would be so rude. You are welcome to return when you learn a little civility.~
@7847  = ~A shame, really. It would be good to see how a life sleeping on a cold dungeon floor makes one irritable and unsociable. I pity you in many ways. Stay as you will, but at least try to be nice.~
@7848  = ~Goodness! How can you be such a boldfaced scoundrel? Such an intrusion is unheard of in the company halflings prefer to keep. The theft alone is but a mere inconvenience, but your inconsiderate attitude... It's almost more than a civil woman can bear. Please leave me.~
@7849  = ~Such is the pull of the wandering way. It's a desire we have all heard much of through the tales of Littleman, though I must confess I cannot truly understand it. It's so much more comfortable spending the nights with family by the hearth. Fare thee well on your journeys.~
@7850  = ~Such is the madness of Littleman. What compels sane people to wander about the wood away from family is beyond me. Good luck to you all the same though.~
@7851  = ~Welcome again. I would have thought you had moved on by now. It's a pleasure you have not, though.~
@7852  = ~I am surprised to see you again. Has not the wanderer's call seized your logic once again? By Dallillia, I hope none of the children follow when you go.~
@7853  = ~Why would he find interest in us, little mother?~
@7854  = ~Why would he find interest in us, little mother?~
@7855  = ~Keep the little whelp away from me. I have no wish to spend my days babysitting your little urchin.~
@7856  = ~Keep the little whelp away from me. I have no wish to spend my days babysitting your little urchin.~
@7857  = ~It is best that he is not here while I rob his home of its possessions.~
@7858  = ~I fear I would have little time to spend in his company. I only meant to stop by for a moment.~
@7859  = ~I fear I would have little time to spend in his company. I only meant to stop by for a moment.~
@7860  = ~Perhaps you'd care to stay a little while and relate some tales. I've always been fond of heroic stories, though I'd never wish to live one.~
@7861  = ~Welcome to you, it's good to meet you finally. I have heard much ado about your visit to our little village.~
@7862  = ~Oh no, we get quite the traffic as far as merchants and caravans go. It's just the wandering adventurer that raises the eyebrows. No doubt you shall feel like quite the spectacle during your stay, but it's only because the small folk admire the spirit of Littleman that you possess. He was our greatest wanderer in all of halfling history. You are an oddity, but also to be admired. Welcome to you, and enjoy your stay.~
@7863  = ~Visitors are not uncommon. Only those that are... unique enough to have cast off hearth and home to follow the wandering life. Not many a small folk can understand why anyone would leave their homes and not seek new ones. I fancy they shall not know whether to call you daft or just... ehh... eccentric. Either way, most will still welcome you to their homes.~
@7864  = ~On the contrary, it's most surprising how many fools we see traipsing off to the Firewine ruins to make their "fortunes." You shall certainly be no different that the many others who have come before. We stand ready to bandage your broken body when you return.~
@7865  = ~It's not that we have not seen your like, rather that we find it sad you are likely to die because of your bravado. Many have come to the Firewine, but fewer have left intact. May the experience of Brandobaris guide your path, as you will certainly need it.~
@7866  = ~We have seen your like before. Rest assured that anything you are ALLOWED to steal you most likely would have been given had you displayed some common courtesy. We are peaceful and polite, but not stupid.~
@7867  = ~*sigh* A shame to see one such as yourself travel the thieving path. More so because you do it so rudely. There is much entertainment in a dashing "liberator of goods," but a common thief is no one's friend. Take what you will, but you will be punished accordingly. It's your choice.~
@7868  = ~A pity. Many of our younger brethren would likely regale in a few tales of your adventures. Confidentially, a few of our elders are retired wanderers not unlike yourselves. You'll not go without welcome should you return.~
@7869  = ~Perhaps it is for the best. While Littleman is a great icon of freedom to our people, the wandering lifestyle is still basically unhealthy. It's best that our young 'uns are not exposed to your type too long. No offense intended.~
@7870  = ~Good to see you again. I am pleased you are more or less still alive. Often we see an adventurer twice, but he is decidedly less talkative the second time around. Dying will do that to you. A hazard of the lifestyle, I guess.~
@7871  = ~You are still alive! Er, no offense meant. It's just that more often than not we never see an adventurer twice, unless he be boxed and burial bound. It's no comment on your abilities, but I never expected to make your acquaintance again. I wish you luck on your further travels.~
@7872  = ~Why should there be such a ruckus? Are visitors so uncommon here?~
@7873  = ~Why should there be such a ruckus? Are visitors so uncommon here?~
@7874  = ~I suppose I am quite the news, eh? Never seen the like of my little group in such a backwater little dump before?~
@7875  = ~I suppose I am quite the news, eh? Never seen the like of my little group in such a backwater little dump before?~
@7876  = ~No doubt they have all warned of my coming? Well, no matter; I shall take what I wish, and there is nothing you can do.~
@7877  = ~No doubt they have all warned of my coming? Well, no matter; I shall take what I wish, and there is nothing you can do.~
@7878  = ~It is flattering that I am such a widespread topic, though I will not be here much longer. Much as I should like to stay, I must be moving on shortly.~
@7879  = ~It is flattering that I am such a widespread topic, though I will not be here much longer. Much as I should like to stay, I must be moving on shortly.~
@7880  = ~As your friend I would tell you NOT to go to the Firewine Bridge, but, knowing your inclination, I will point out its location here on your map.~
@7881  = ~Hail and hello. Welcome in my home you are... for now.~
@7882  = ~It's nothing against you personally, just your profession. I've had kin lose their lives chasing some fool dream down a dungeon. It was someone like you that put him to it, though that can't be your fault. Welcome to our village, but please be kind enough to leave with the same number of people you arrived with.~
@7883  = ~I bear all of your type a grudge. The rest of the village may think it unkind of me, but you fool dungeon rats are the reason I no longer have by brother by my side. He followed a group not unlike yours, and wound up dead in some dank hole. I suppose I canna hold you responsible for his choices, but that doesn't mean I have to enjoy your company. My apologies.~
@7884  = ~You wouldn't know a decent home if it jumped up and bit your nethers! Bah! Get your wandering tail out of my burrow; I'll not welcome you at MY hearth.~
@7885  = ~Bah! Your kind of wanderer has already taken my most precious possession. The life of my brother was wasted following a group like yours around. That you have come to steal whatever is left is nothing more than a confirmation of what I already knew; those that wander are either scoundrels, thieves, or fools. I leave it up to you to decide which of these YOU are. Get out of my home.~
@7886  = ~My apologies. Please, don't let my course manner send you away when every other home in Gullykin welcomed you. I am sour towards the wandering folk, but it is nothing personal. I lost a brother to a dungeon, but that is no more your fault than mine. Stay as you will, and forgive me my coarse behavior.~
@7887  = ~It's best that you go, before I disgrace myself further with rudeness. I mean no insult, but I cannot look upon a wanderer without thinking of my lost brother. He followed a group like yours and was lost in the depths of a dungeon. Please understand... and please do not return to my home.~
@7888  = ~It is good to see you still alive, though I'll thank you to keep your stay in my home brief.~
@7889  = ~You are a continuing ill wind in my home. I do not wish to make you unwelcome... but you are.~
@7890  = ~You seem a bit hesitant. Why should you bear me any grudge?~
@7891  = ~You seem a bit hesitant. Why should you bear me any grudge?~
@7892  = ~Why should I wish to spend ANY time in a hovel such as this? How you halfwits can stand these shacks is beyond me.~
@7893  = ~I shall spend as much time here as I like! And TAKE what I like, I might add.~
@7894  = ~I can sense that you do not really wish my company. I shall take my leave.~
@7895  = ~I can sense that you do not really wish my company. I shall take my leave.~
@7896  = ~Well, friend, why don't you join me by the hearth? I have an extra pipe that you could use. I have a feeling though, that you adventuring types never have time for relaxation.~
@7897  = ~Well, hello there! Welcome to mine home, fellow wanderers! How could I turn you away when we share a common spirit? I'll wager none of the village understands you as I do.~
@7898  = ~How indeed, but for having been there myself! Ahh, it was the grand old days when I roamed the land, stirring up trouble as I went. Swung a blade with the best, I did! Of course the rest of the village thought me mad... MAD, for leaving house and hearth! They just could not understand, but they welcomed me back when the rigors of the road left me somewhat aged. Still, what a grand time it was! Stay by my fire and mayhaps sometime we shall swap tales of derring-do over a mug or three! Just not right now. I am a mite tired and need my rest.~
@7899  = ~Why, how does anyone who travels the roads claim to know another? By the little glint of madness in the eye and the feet that never stay still. You are welcome in my home, but keep your weapons at your sides and your fingers in your pockets. We are all friends here, and I should hate to lose that friendship over a few measly trinkets.~
@7900  = ~Ha! I remember the likes of you amongst the men I traveled with as well! Couldn't stay his razor tongue for the life of him. Eventually that's what it cost him too. There might be a lesson for you in that, but who am I to preach? Just the voice of experience. Perhaps you are not as welcome in my home as I thought you would be. Make your stay short.~
@7901  = ~You would do well to heed your elders. Just because I'm a touch weathered now doesn't mean I didn't put the boots to your equals a hundred times over. A friendly warning, and a not so friendly goodbye.~
@7902  = ~Hmm, I can tell by your demeanor I have nothing you would find valuable. All that I have kept is of sentimental value, priceless to me and mine heart alone. An old rusty blade, a weathered shield... May you live to see the worth of such things. Please leave me to my thoughts.~
@7903  = ~I understand the pull that keeps you moving. Be on your way then, and may Brandobaris guide you to a safe and happy home when you seek it.~
@7904  = ~Back again? I am surprised you have not gone on to grand new places instead of returning to this humble home. You are welcome while you stay, but I know it won't be long before you move on.~
@7905  = ~Ahh, I see you have gone another day without a knife in your gullet. Perhaps you have learned to control your wayward wit, or perhaps not and you are just quick-footed. Luck be yours on your travels, young one.~
@7906  = ~My thanks for your hospitality, but how do you claim to know me so well?~
@7907  = ~My thanks for your hospitality, but how do you claim to know me so well?~
@7908  = ~I have nothing in common with one such as you. It's more likely that your mind, and not your spirit, wanders now.~
@7909  = ~I have nothing in common with one such as you. It's more likely that your mind, and not your spirit, wanders now.~
@7910  = ~A "fellow wanderer," hmm? Then surely you have accumulated some valuable knickknacks in your travels. Perhaps I should relieve you of them.~
@7911  = ~No doubt you have tales of places far and wide, but I fear I have not the time to hear them.~
@7912  = ~I think it would be inhospitable of me not to aid you in your future adventures. I have a little knick-knack from the old days; something you might find of use. Take this sling; it doesn't look to be much, but trust me it's come in handy more than once.~
@7913  = ~Wow, are you going to the Firewine ruins? You must be brave an' stuff. I wanted to go there someday, but Nanna wouldn't like it.~
@7914  = ~Yeah, Nanna knows a lot about everything. I'll stay here till I'm strong like you, then go traveling. I hear of lots of wonderful places from the merchants and caravans. You better go. Nanna will get nervous if she sees you talking with me.~
@7915  = ~I take care of myself fine! Nanna just needs me here to help out, so it wouldn't be fair to her to leave. You better go. Nanna will get nervous if she sees you talking with me.~
@7916  = ~A baby! I'll show you AND Nanna! I just gotta get a little bit older and I'm off and running. I'll go everywhere you have and better! You'll see!~
@7917  = ~You think she would? YEAH! She would like that. I'll get just a bit older and then watch all the great things I'll bring back! Thanks! I'll be just like you! I bet your poppa's proud of you!~
@7918  = ~Well, I dunno. Nanna never wanted stuff like that before. I better think about it some more. Thanks for the talk.~
@7919  = ~Hi again! Better be quiet 'cause Nanna doesn't want you makin' me leave.~
@7920  = ~You go away! I'll show you an' everybody soon enough!~
@7921  = ~Your Nanna sounds wise. Best you wait until you can take care of yourself before you set out on your own.~
@7922  = ~Your Nanna sounds wise. Best you wait until you can take care of yourself before you set out on your own.~
@7923  = ~It's just as well. A baby like you wouldn't last a second out from under the apron!~
@7924  = ~Nonsense! One day you'll bring her home a gem the size of your fist and she'll change her mind.~
@7925  = ~Nonsense! One day you'll bring her home a gem the size of your fist and she'll change her mind.~
@7926  = ~I wish Nanna would let me go out with you. I wish, I wish... Aw, she'll never let me go. Before you go, how 'bout I give you somethin' to help you out. I know it's really valuable, 'cause Nanna keeps it all locked up. I kinda borrowed it for a while, but now I want you to have it. Here ya go. Come back soon and tell me 'bout all your adventures.~
@7927  = ~By the gods of health and hearth, it's good to see the Friendly Arm again! Can anyone here imagine a better sight than these hallowed halls looming before you, when you've had bandits at your backside all the way from Baldur's Gate?~
@7928  = ~Treacherous? Treacherous, my friend? Had the earth opened beneath my feet and spewed forth all the vermin infesting all the Nine Hells, it could not have been more treacherous. Banditry at all sides and I had naught but my feet, and how fast they moved to protect me. The singular thought that kept me on my path? This shining beacon; this plane of joy; this well-priced mead hall; call it what you will, but the Friendly Arm is home to me. Bentley! A mead on the house for the good advertising I give you, my friend!~
@7929  = ~Eh? How treacherous? Treacherous enough that I must forgo my usual blustering tale of the journey and push past you friend, lest I die of thirst before I reach the bar. Beware the north if you be allergic to bandits! Bentley! A bottle of your second-cheapest wine!~
@7930  = ~And neither, my friend, do I care for your opinion. If you cannot share in my joy and jubilation, then sit to the side and I shall steer it around you. I'll not step on your toes, but be sure you neither step on mine.~
@7931  = ~For shame! A fellow traveler by the looks, but by the sound you spout you were made irritable by the journey. While I celebrate that it is over, you fret that it happened. Lighten up, as they say, and you'll sleep better at night.~
@7932  = ~That might have been funny if delivered by someone of better persuasion. Alas, as it stands I am angered as though insulted. One should never dwell on such things though. I shall think no less of you, though I doubt I shall think any MORE of you either. Fare thee well... somewhere else.~
@7933  = ~HA! You know me well, and yet we have never met. No matter, for we are friends until death! So swears Wade of no great distinction. Best that you keep off the trade route north, lest a friendship-ending condition come to pass far sooner than later.~
@7934  = ~And so I sesh to the guy, "But if that's you shister, where'sh my WIFE?" HAW! Oh sorry, did I just spit on you? Oh, it's my friend back again! Just trying to drink enough courage to head back on that dusty trail. Perhaps I shall stay a touch longer, though; the sky is clear, but my own head is cloudy.~
@7935  = ~Well, how's that for a surprise kick in the head? The sourpuss hast returned to the land of merrymakers. I trust you will be a little more amiable?~
@7936  = ~You sound most relieved to have made it here. How treacherous was your passage?~
@7937  = ~You sound most relieved to have made it here. How treacherous was your passage?~
@7938  = ~Put a cork in it, you blustering fool! I care not a whit for the tale of your passage.~
@7939  = ~Put a cork in it, you blustering fool! I care not a whit for the tale of your passage.~
@7940  = ~An ale for this weary traveler! Best that we put something in front of his mouth if we are ever to shut him up.~
@7941  = ~An ale for this weary traveler! Best that we put something in front of his mouth if we are ever to shut him up.~
@7942  = ~Good friends! Have a round on me!~
@7943  = ~A weary traveler out of Baldur's Gate has told us that the road between that city and the Friendly Arm is teeming with bandits.~
@7944  = ~A traveler just out of Baldur's Gate has told us that the Coast Way is a dangerous road to travel. Bandits assault all who travel its length.~
@7945  = ~Welcome to the Friendly Arm. I trust you know the rules of conduct within?~
@7946  = ~Perhaps "rules" is a touch too formal. It is unwritten, but accepted, that while herein you will act with the utmost of civility to all other guests. This is neutral ground, and all grievances are left at the gates. If the grievances come in, then you will go out. Enjoy your stay.~
@7947  = ~Constraining as they are to a person of your... ilk, there are rules of conduct within the Arm. It is neutral ground, first and foremost. Everyone is welcome so long as quarrels are left at the gates. If they are not, then YOU will be. Welcome, and behave yourself.~
@7948  = ~You will follow the rules that everyone must! Best you remember that. The Arm is neutral ground first and foremost. Beyond that, there is no fighting permitted. If you ignore this, whether you win or lose you will be ejected. Am I clear? Good. Enjoy your stay. Don't make me shorten it.~
@7949  = ~Good then. Enjoy your stay.~
@7950  = ~I don't care much for your tone. Best you make sure that your common sense is every bit as common as everyone else's is.~

@7957  = ~All I can tell you is that the roads from here to Baldur's Gate are not as safe as they used to be. Bandits pounce on the unwary, so keep a mind to be on watch on your travels.~
@7958  = ~What is the meaning of this intrusion? I pay good money for my privacy, by what right do you disturb it?!~
@7959  = ~Be sure it is not repeated. Leave me.~
@7960  = ~I should not doubt it, for you are most assuredly "simple." Leave me, and see that you do not return.~
@7961  = ~You are most assuredly daft if you expect me to answer that! If this were other than the Friendly Arm, I would have you in stocks for a fortnight. I've no desire to trouble any of the staff with a matter as trivial as a petty thief, so you had best turn about and go whence you came.~
@7962  = ~No, you certainly may not! My business is my concern, and so it shall remain. Begone from my quarters before I call the guard.~
@7963  = ~I have told you previously to leave me alone. Do as I ask, lest we both regret the consequences.~
@7964  = ~My sincere apologies, sire. It was a simple mistake in room numbers.~
@7965  = ~My sincere apologies, sire. It was a simple mistake in room numbers.~

@7971  = ~You just do that! Bursting in here like that; it's just not gentlemanly!~
@7972  = ~Y-y-you can't start nothin' in here! The guard will be on you so fast you'll hit the ninth plane before you know you're dead.~
@7973  = ~H-h-heh, you're kidding, right? Right? Y-you must be. Nobody is stupid enough to go attackin' people in the Friendly Arm. Even if the guards don't get ya, word'll spread so fast about what you done it will make your head spin.~
@7974  = ~Lucky for you that you think I have nothing, 'cause if'n I caught you at it you'd be pitched from the Arm faster'n anything. Ain't nothing worse I can think of than to be barred from the Friendly Arm. Word of that would spread like crazy.~
@7975  = ~The Arm caters to everyone, and everyone is more or less equal under her roof. Some of the rooms do cost a bit more, but there is room for everyone at almost every price.~

@7986  = ~See that you don't, or the next time the guard will be waiting for you.~
@7987  = ~No, I don't suppose that you do. You look much more like a group of brigands casing my room for valuables and gold. Perhaps you should consider a career in the domestic arts. A maid is much less likely to end her career on the end of a polearm, unlike the job you have presently selected for yourself. Just a thought. I trust you will be going now?~
@7988  = ~My business is just that: MY business. If this answer is not good enough, I suggest you complain to Bentley at the bar. Tell him that you broke into my room and demanded to know my personal affairs. I'm sure he will express sympathy for you as he has the guards "escort" you off the property. I trust you will be leaving now? Good day to you.~

@7993  = ~Pardon the interruption, but what is your business here at the Inn?~
@7994  = ~Being a good friend, I'd like to entrust you with this valuable ring. It's an heirloom, and I'm afraid of it being pilfered. With all the thieves and brigands loitering in the wilderness, it's not too much to assume that there might be more here at the inn.~
@7995  = ~About time you showed! Here, I need these tunics cleaned and pressed by this eve, and be EXTRA careful with the golden pantaloons! It took fifteen women and a small boy from Calimshan twelve days and four nights to weave them, so careful on the seams! Well? Get going!~
@7996  = ~Not the cleaner? NOT THE CLEANER?! Oh well, my mistake. I thank you for your honesty, I thank you for not stealing the pantaloons, and I will thank you kindly not to mention the padding in the codpiece. Good day.~
@7997  = ~NOT THE CLEANER? Then what in all the Nine Hells are you doing with my clothes?! Do you THINK I would trust my washing and mending to someone who was not a professional in the field?! Give me those!~
@7998  = ~Service with a smile and a snap in your step. That's what we like to see. Now get going, damn you! Not a coin for a tip if there's even ONE tear!~
@7999  = ~Done and done! Be on your way.~
@8000  = ~Wait a moment! Don't you dare go anywhere!~
@8001  = ~Here's an extra couple of coins... put in a pleat that would make Daddy proud, if you know what I mean. Now get!~
@8002  = ~I... see. Well then, what about carpets? Do you do carpets? No, I don't suppose you do. Oh, this is terrible! A dinner date of momentous magnitude, and here I am with dirty pantaloons! Granted they are golden, but the shame is still there! Leave, leave me to my impending social doom! Oh, WOE!~
@8003  = ~Well, I certainly think it was totally unnecessary for you to cast shame upon the domestics of our society when they perform such a vital function! Fie upon you and your disrespectful attitude! Begone!~
@8004  = ~And thank you SO much for bringing up mother!~
@8005  = ~Back again? Good! I'll just take these back and... What?! I have never seen such shoddy work! It's as though they were not touched at all! Such a wait for this quality of service is unforgivable! I am afraid you leave me no alternative... but to withhold your tip. Good day!~
@8006  = ~You again?! I should think you wouldn't show your face around here after absconding with my pantaloons! Had a good long talk to that management about you. He dared to try and avoid responsibility by saying that he had no laundry staff. I gave him a thorough dressing down, but he stuck by his story. Left me in quite the tizzy, I assure you. Get out of my presence; I'll have nothing more to do with any of the lot of you!~
@8007  = ~Well, if it isn't you once more. Look, I don't wish to appear frightfully rude, but if you have no skill in the domestic arts then I have little purpose for you. Leave me be.~
@8008  = ~Much as I have always dreamed of owning golden pantaloons, I must confess that I am not the cleaner that you were expecting.~

@8015  = ~HA! Me prepared for plenty death! All YOURS! You fall for trap, like all others! Me pester little halflings, and "heroes" come to dungeon! They always have better treasure than simple halflings! Now we fight, you die, and me get all you have! RAAAAGH!~
@8016  = ~Ha HA! Me count on it! Many before you come and die! Many more gonna come after you, to face the "great evil" so they be heroes! Fools! I lay trap and bait for all! Pester little tiny-people and richer victims come to die! Now your turn! DIE!~
@8017  = ~Of course me do! Me just pester half-people so fools like you come racing in! You powerful? Good! Powerful fools have best treasure! Now you die like all else!~
@8018  = ~We've come to put an end to your evil tyranny! You and your minions will bother Gullykin no more! Prepare to die!~
@8019  = ~You'll never get any peace here, ogre scum! If not us, then someone else will come to stop you!~
@8020  = ~Couldn't we have a peaceful solution to this? I'm sure you don't really want to fight a powerful foe like us.~
@8021  = ~ 'Allo, friend, wot can I do for you this day?~
@8022  = ~Oh, it's no trouble at all. You can expect nothing but the best in service from the Thunderhammer smithy. Best armors in the land. If you need some help, don't hesitate to speak to Taerom himself.~
@8023  = ~Well, I would appreciate it if you would be quick about it. Don't need you in here crowding about while we try to work. I am quite sure Taerom does not care for loiterers. If you need any help, speak directly to him. Best smith in Faerun, I'll wager.~
@8024  = ~Speak to Taerom like that and you'll likely end up with a stoker shoved so far up your— Well, it's not for a gentleman to say. I would advise you to be polite while in his shop.~
@8025  = ~This is perhaps not the largest of settlements, but you can rest assured that Taerom Thunderhammer is the best smith in all the planes. You'll not find a finer set of armor than you can get here, and you'll not find a group of workers more devoted to their employer. More importantly, you'll not find a group of workers more willing to bash the teeth of anyone who badmouths Taerom! Tread carefully... and politely.~
@8026  = ~Fare thee well then.~
@8027  = ~I trust you have learned some manners since we last met? If not, there is the door.~
@8028  = ~Welcome back. Hopefully we can be of assistance.~
@8029  = ~No need to trouble yourself; I'm just browsing about your smithy. I have heard much about it.~
@8030  = ~No need to trouble yourself; I'm just browsing about your smithy. I have heard much about it.~
@8031  = ~You can get out of my face, is what you can do. I'll summon you when I need you.~
@8032  = ~You can do nothing. I'll not buy armor from a shop in a backwater village such as this.~
@8033  = ~Nothing, thanks. I was just leaving.~
@8034  = ~Friend, I'd like you to take this armor with you when you depart. I would be terribly upset if you were to come to harm while out adventuring.~
@8035  = ~Ahh! By what right are ye in mine house?!~
@8036  = ~What I am doing be no concern of yours! Leave at once, lest I call the guards!~
@8037  = ~Then leave me and mine! You were not invited to my home so get out!~
@8038  = ~I can do naught to stop you, but I can call those who can. Leave now, lest the guard dispatch you.~
@8039  = ~And well you should! If my husband were to catch you here, it would surely be the end of you!~
@8040  = ~I am sorry for intruding, but I was just wondering what you were doing.~
@8041  = ~Save your breath, I mean you no harm.~
@8042  = ~By right of might! I would suggest that you cooperate while I help myself to your valuables.~
@8043  = ~My apologies! I must have the wrong address. I will leave immediately.~
@8044  = ~I'm a simple town girl, and I don't think anything I know would be of any use to mighty adventurers.~
@8045  = ~I told you before. I don't want you here! Now git!~
@8046  = ~Burglars! Explain thyself, lest the guards loose you from your life!~
@8047  = ~I don't know whether you are a fool or a liar, but it's best for thee that I cannot decide. You have a chance to leave before I call the watchmen. Best that you make your next move a wise one.~
@8048  = ~You mock me! It's obvious you are a rogue in sheep's clothing! Leave immediately or I'll have the guards set upon you!~
@8049  = ~So be it then! I would rather that than lose mine hard-earned property to a skulking brigand such as yourself! If you kill me, surely the guard shall dispatch you as well. Run while you can!~
@8050  = ~It would seem I am at a disadvantage, but know this: If I ever see you again I'll not hesitate to call upon the guard, and you shall suffer a long while without seeing the sun, at the very least!~
@8051  = ~As well you should! Begone from mine home!~
@8052  = ~No need to call the guards; I just had a desire to see this fine house from within.~
@8053  = ~No need to call the guards; I just had a desire to see this fine house from within.~
@8054  = ~Call the guards and you'll not live to see them arrive!~
@8055  = ~Call the guards and you'll not live to see them arrive!~
@8056  = ~I meant no harm! I shall leave at once!~
@8057  = ~The only thing I know of that might pique you interest are the rumors I've heard of an abandoned wizards' school to the east. I couldn't tell you where it is, but it's supposed to overflow with magical treasure.~
@8058  = ~We charmed a man named Galteran. He told us that there was an abandoned wizard school to the east, and that there was much treasure to be found there.~
@8059  = ~What? Who are you?~
@8060  = ~Aye, it is at that. It's well maintained, though I fail to see how that gives you leave to enter as you will. Better leave soon lest the guards be called.~
@8061  = ~It's no more my home than yours! The difference, I think, is that I was invited and you were not! Imagine! Disrupting an old man's home like this. Solgen will be most displeased! Please leave lest you disturb him.~
@8062  = ~There is little I can do to stop you entering, but the longer you impose your presence, the more likely it is that the guards will be escorting you when you leave! You have been warned!~
@8063  = ~Good! It would never do for you to be in here giving old Solgen the fright!~
@8064  = ~Just a curious passerby. It's a lovely home that you have here.~
@8065  = ~Just a curious passerby. It's a lovely home that you have here.~
@8066  = ~I am <CHARNAME>! Don't dally about with questions! Stand aside!~
@8067  = ~Sorry, my mistake. I shall leave at once.~
@8068  = ~I'm rather ignorant, even for a peasant. Perhaps you don't quite comprehend what I'm telling you; I'm a mental midget, a moron, an idiot. A fruit fly has more intelligence than I do; a brain-damaged ant has more wits than I could ever muster. So I'd have to say using your magics to take control of my mind was a waste of a spell.~
@8069  = ~Who... who is there? I was expecting no visitors. A-armed as you are you are probably thieves, no? Please, don't hurt me.~
@8070  = ~Then what possible reason do you have for being in my home? The door was closed. There is no "accidental" way to bypass it. Please, if you have no business here then leave.~
@8071  = ~I have but meager savings and possessions. You'll get very little from me. Please just leave me in peace.~
@8072  = ~You must be deranged to be breaking into homes just to look at them! Such needless fright you must cause. Please, leave my home as you found it!~
@8073  = ~I am no thief. My apologies for having scared you.~
@8074  = ~You're pretty quick to grasp the situation. Remain quiet and I'll not hurt you in the least.~
@8075  = ~I've no interest in you at all. I simply wished to explore the house.~
@8076  = ~I'm a weak old man, whose memory's begun to fail. I don't think you'll find much use with me.~
@8077  = ~How dare you come into my home uninvited! Back in my adventuring days, such an affront would get you a sword in the backside! If 'twere not for social convention I'd give you a right proper thrashing!~
@8078  = ~For someone who goes about breaking into houses, you certainly "appear" to have half a brain. Best that you use it and leave.~
@8079  = ~Quite obviously you expected to find some helpless waif to rob. Get out. The very sight of you makes me sick.~
@8080  = ~Yes, slink back to whatever hole you crawled from. I hope to never see you darken my door again!~
@8081  = ~False bravado as you turn tail. How pathetic. Get out of my house.~
@8082  = ~I wouldn't dream of dirtying my hands on the likes of you, but if you so much as touch a single coin in my coffers I'll have the guards here so fast you'll be three planes down before you know you're dead!~
@8083  = ~I'm no more patient now than when you first burgled in here. Turn and leave, lest you regret it for the rest of your very short life!~
@8084  = ~There is no need for that. You are obviously experienced at taking care of yourself, and I wouldn't dream of attacking you.~
@8085  = ~There is no need for that. You are obviously experienced at taking care of yourself, and I wouldn't dream of attacking you.~
@8086  = ~It is certain that would be a fight you would lose, milady. Be thankful I've no interest in testing your resolve. I'll be going now.~

@8090  = ~I'll thank you to turn and leave the way you came. This is a private residence.~
@8091  = ~Please, I dislike causing a scene but I'll call the guards if I must. I'll not have you stealing my things from under my own nose.~
@8092  = ~I have no choice left to me! Guards! Arrest this burglar!~

@8095  = ~I "might" be Borland of Beregost. My door is always open to any who might need shelter. You are on your honor not to misuse my trust, and may come and go as you wish.~
@8096  = ~I am Borland of Beregost. Why this is of import to you I don't know. It's information easily gleaned from a casual meeting on the street and hardly worth barging into my home for. Please leave and spare me the effort of learning to dislike you.~
@8097  = ~Indeed? If that is the case, then you won't mind leaving with all possible haste. Begone from my "common" home.~
@8098  = ~I am sure that was meant as an insult, but I will not take it as such. Halflings are among the most generous of races I have ever had the pleasure to deal with. Being compared to one of their number is a great compliment, though I confess I lack their accompanying tact and manners. For instance, they would never dream of having guards drag you from one of their burrows, and yet I was considering that very thing. It's embarrassing that I lack their self-control. Perhaps you should leave before I am put in the position of acting this through.~
@8099  = ~Hello again. I trust you are enjoying Beregost in all its meager splendor?~
@8100  = ~You are unwelcome in my house. It's a phrase I am unused to saying, but nevertheless it is true. Please leave.~

@8104  = ~You do not lock your doors? That's almost halfling in its foolishness.~
@8105  = ~Ha ha ha, you cannot charm me, for I am utterly unimportant.~
@8106  = ~Hold your place. No need for us to get off on the wrong foot. I rather like company occasionally, but most of the townsfolk are a bit standoffish.~
@8107  = ~That is an unfortunate possibility. They do seem to take a touch too much pleasure from their positions, but I'd sooner have them than not. I doubt I should feel safe without them, what with the banditry rampant about the countryside. Mayhaps when things have settled I can maintain a more open house. Leave me please, as a member of the town council there is much that weighs on my mind.~
@8108  = ~Apes? Their demeanor may be gruff, but it is thoroughly appropriate for their task. Perhaps it is a tad unsociable, but necessary in these turbulent times.~
@8109  = ~*sigh* I get so few visitors, and when I do, they are common thieves. Leave immediately, please, lest I must instruct my guards to "help" you to the door.~
@8110  = ~You visit again? It is not unwelcome, even though Carl and Jurgen may make it seem so. Do not overstay your welcome though, as I am unaccustomed to long visits.~
@8111  = ~You are definitely one of the more persistent pests I have had to my home. Again I must ask you to leave lest you be "escorted" out.~
@8112  = ~I cannot understand why, sir. You've a lovely home and seem quite amiable. Perhaps it is because of those two guards you employ?~
@8113  = ~I've no doubt that you get few visitors. It is unlikely they would voluntarily subject themselves to the apes at the door.~
@8114  = ~Your social problems are no concern of mine. It was a rich looking house, so I entered; it is well guarded, so I will leave.~
@8115  = ~I have the sudden urge to give you a gift, friend. Take this little bauble, it's a childhood memento. I think it's fitting that you, my closest companion, keep it for me.~
@8116  = ~I advise you to be on your best behavior while in this house. I will be watching you VERY closely.~
@8117  = ~Best you watch your step in here, stranger. A word from Mr. Travenhurst, and you are gutted like a trout.~
@8118  = ~Halt scum! You make a false move while here and I'll run you through!~
@8119  = ~Aye, we've our eyes on you.~
@8120  = ~Hehe, like a trout.~
@8121  = ~Better listen to him. He's just not right in the head. Hehe.~
@8122  = ~Well, hello there. Not too sure what you expected to find in here, but perhaps you have come to the wrong house by mistake. I am Galteran, and I was just doing a bit of cleaning in the spare time I find myself with. Not much call for my grunt-type labor right now, what with caravans staying away. *sigh* Ah, well. Best be on your way, please.~
@8123  = ~I do not know who you are or what you are doing in my home, but please leave. Sorry, but I have little patience right now. There is little call for my line of work when no caravans dare leave the city.~

@8130  = ~Sorry if I seem a touch flustered, but I just don't want anyone upsetting my husband any more than he already is. Please leave.~
@8131  = ~It's an honor to be in the presence of such great heroes.~
@8132  = ~If you're here about the job, you may as well go on home. Sorry, but there ain't gonna be no caravan now. All the merchants pulled out, saying it's too dangerous. Guess that leaves us grunt types out of luck. I'll put the word out if anything gets better. Goodbye.~
@8133  = ~I'm afraid I'm in no mood to speak to anyone right now, especially if you've come about the job! Ain't gonna be no caravan now, so there ain't no job neither. Blasted bandits! Scared all the merchants so bad they won't budge. Might as well leave, 'cause you ain't gonna find no work here.~
@8134  = ~I'm in no mood for talking! Best that you get out whilst I can still manage a courteous greeting.~

@8138  = ~What are you doing in here?! This is my home... was my... I suppose it really doesn't matter if you come in or not. My family has already left for Baldur's Gate to stay with relatives, and I shall soon follow. I'll not feel safe until we are all within its great gates. Enter as you will, there is naught left for you to steal.~
@8139  = ~Don't bother me, I'm busy packing.~
@8140  = ~The bandit raids have really put a scare into the people of Beregost.~
@8141  = ~It's been nice being on such friendly terms, but I have to be going soon. If you're going to come with me, then hurry up and get prepared.~
@8142  = ~Well, hello there. I fear you have "mistaken" my unlocked door as an invitation to enter. Forgive me if this was misleading, as it was not my intent to allow entry to just any stranger off the street. Please accept my apologies, but I should appreciate it if you would leave. Mine husband is one of the guards and I should think he would be perturbed if there were people milling about his house when he got home.~
@8143  = ~I should not like to appear rude, but you have entered mine house without permission. I hardly think merely having an unlocked door is an invitation. Leave lest my husband extricate you himself when he returns from guard duty.~
@8144  = ~You must be a considerable fool to enter this house uninvited. Best that you should leave, because if I call the guard there is a good chance my husband will be with them. No doubt he would expel you from his own house with... extra vigor.~
@8145  = ~My husband should be here soon; I would suggest that you leave.~
@8146  = ~I wish I could run away with you darling, but my husband can be such a jealous man. I wouldn't want to arouse his wrath. Take this ring, with which you may always remember me.~
@8147  = ~Welcome my dear, you are early I— Excuse me. Indeed I was expecting visitors, but none such as you. Begone, before my company arrives. I should not tolerate the mood being ruined by a band of miscreants.~
@8148  = ~You again?! You have certainly taken an unhealthy interest in my personal affairs. I should like you to make a hasty exit and not return lest I be forced into drastic actions.~
@8149  = ~I can tolerate no more of your incursions! Dispose of these nosy vermin!~
@8150  = ~I hate this whole climate of fear that the bandits have placed us in. I tell you, one day I'm gonna do something about it! You're my friend, why don't you do something about it?!~
@8151  = ~Who? Oh, forgive my disposition, but we were expecting some overdue friends. Mr. Colquetle will be most disappointed. Please do not bother him.~
@8152  = ~I doubt you will get much of a warm reception here. Mr. Colquetle is in quite a state.~
@8153  = ~I'm sure Mr. Colquetle would find you the most enjoyable guest.~
@8154  = ~Strangers tramping about my home? Bah, what does it matter? I have heard nothing from my son and his wife for nigh unto a week now, and all else pales in importance until I do. I should have known better than to allow his travel in these dangerous times. Leave me to my sorrows.~
@8155  = ~What cruel whim of the fates controls this torment of me?! Is it not enough that my son is gone missing, that I must also suffer hooligans tramping about my home? Leave or I shall have the guard dispatch you. I'll not show charity to unwanted thieves when I am denied the same. Go!~
@8156  = ~Please, no visitors today. I am quite unwell with grief over my missing son. I told the fool not to travel in such times, especially with wife and child in tow, but he would not listen. Now I have no idea where he... wait. Where did you... WHERE DID YOU GET THAT AMULET?!~
@8157  = ~It is... it was my son's. Please, might I have it?~
@8158  = ~Catches the light...? You are either utterly cold-hearted or a complete buffoon! That "trinket" belonged to my son! Please, give it to me!~
@8159  = ~You profited? You are a most cold-hearted individual! That amulet was my son's, so those "fools" you saw dead were him and his family! Bah! I would have asked for it as a keepsake, but you have despoiled it with your filthy profiteering ways! Get out of my sight!~
@8160  = ~For a price?! You would have me PAY for an item you took from the corpse of my son?! You are utterly cold-hearted, and a fool to boot! Paying the likes of you for the amulet would forever taint my memory of him! Begone from my sight, and take that... thing with you.~
@8161  = ~Sell it...? You care for gold so much that you would deny a man his son's last possession? Keep it then and begone! I cannot bear the sight of such as you for any longer!~
@8162  = ~I thank you. Funny, isn't it? How a simple piece of cut glass takes on so much more worth? Please, leave me.~
@8163  = ~Hello? Oh, 'tis you again. If you please, I am rather not in the mood for speaking right now. Leave me.~
@8164  = ~You again?! You tempt the very fates by daring to come in to MY house again! I'll not suffer your presence a second more than I have to! Begone!~
@8165  = ~This trinket? It is but a scrap left behind by some vulturous marauders. It catches the light quite nicely though.~
@8166  = ~This trinket? It is but a scrap left behind by some vulturous marauders. It catches the light quite nicely though.~
@8167  = ~Some fools dared the road to Nashkel and were cut down by bandits. They had no further use for it, or anything else they carried. It was a shame to see, but I profited in the end, so all is well.~
@8168  = ~It was certainly a piteous sight. A young family cut down in a cowardly raid. This was among their meager belongings.~
@8169  = ~Of course, sir. It is regretful that I could not have arrived sooner and prevented their deaths.~
@8170  = ~For a price. It should be worth a great deal to you, no?~
@8171  = ~I think not. I have carried it a great distance and selling it will cover my expenses quite nicely.~
@8172  = ~Of course, sir. It is regretful that I could not have arrived sooner and prevented their deaths.~
@8173  = ~For a price. It should be worth a great deal to you, no?~
@8174  = ~I think not. I have carried it a great distance and selling it will cover my expenses quite nicely.~
@8175  = ~Please don't bother me, especially if you call me friend. My son is most likely dead, killed along with his wife and child by those accursed bandits!~
@8176  = ~Oooh, mother surely is not going to like you pokin' your nose in here! Strangers in her kitchen? She'll not likely let that pass unnoticed.~
@8177  = ~I wouldn't stick around if I were you. Mother can be quite the hellion when she's roused.~
@8178  = ~I'm not married, you know. I'm just looking for the right fella to come along...~
@8179  = ~Who might you be? No, don't answer because I really don't care. You have gone and tracked up my kitchen with nary an invitation, nor even an unlocked door! You better get going, or the only thing worse than the guard coming to take you off, will be if they don't get there in time to save you from me! Out!~
@8180  = ~Shoo!~
@8181  = ~Don't make me break mine foot off in your nethers! Get going!~
@8182  = ~If you want, I could give you an entire course on cooking. But knowing you adventurer types, you won't be around long enough.~
@8183  = ~'Ello, friends. Welcome, and make yourselves at home. Just try not to rattle the locals none, okay? Times is pretty harsh right now, and people don't need any more trouble than they've got. So, what can I do for you?~
@8184  = ~'Ere there. I want's no trouble from you roustabouts. Looks ta me like you wuz probably thrown outta every other bar in town. Well, if you act up, you'll get the same treatment here. Otherwise, welcome. So, what can I do for you?~
@8185  = ~Oh! You startled me. I'm not used to strangers because traveling is so dangerous now. Please don't linger too long here. The children are leery of anyone they don't know, and 'tis hard enough keeping them calm when there is just me around. If only my husband hadn't gone to work the mines at Nashkel...~
@8186  = ~Who are you that you can just barge in here? With travel so dangerous, it's no wonder there are but ruffians like you left in town. Please leave lest the children get upset because of the strangers in their house. They'll hardly sleep now for fear they'll miss even a second with their father if he should come home. I wish I had their faith.~
@8187  = ~If you don't leave at once, I shall call for someone to "help" you.~
@8188  = ~I have nothing to say.~
@8189  = ~MOMMMM! Someone's in the house! Oooo, you are gonna get it if you don't leave. Daddy might come home and give you such a whuppin'.~
@8190  = ~Do you people look so silly on purpose, or were you in a horrible ugly-stick accident?~
@8191  = ~Let's go have a game of hide-and-go-seek.~
@8192  = ~I'm waiting for Daddy to come home an' tuck me in. He's sure to be here soon. He can't stay at the mines forever... can he?~
@8193  = ~The reason he's not coming home is because he's dead, kiddo. He's mulch, deceased, expired, kicked the bucket, bought the farm, croaked.~
@8194  = ~Your dad will probably be coming back soon. Don't you worry.~
@8195  = ~I really hope so. I miss him so much.~
@8196  = ~Waaaahhh! My daddy's dead!~
@8197  = ~I'm your best friend.~
@8198  = ~Ahh! You scared me! I wasn't takin' anything! Honest! I was just checking out the house, that's all. Someone's got to watch over the place, 'cuz I am SURE they will come back. The Greycarts only went to Baldur's Gate to visit and they should be back already. I'm gonna wait right here till they do.~
@8199  = ~~
@8200  = ~Nice house, huh? My buddy is Dason Greycart, and he says his daddy makes good money as a merchant. Not so much nowadays, I guess. Especially if he don't come back soon. He's got customers here waitin' for him. I'll wait right here and help him unload, like I always do.~
@8201  = ~There should be some good money hidden away in this house. Just tear the place apart, I'm sure you'll find something.~
@8202  = ~Keep a low profile if you please. Tempers are short fer strangers right now. So, what do ya want?~
@8203  = ~Hey, you stays out of my kitchen! You'll mess up my art! Someday I'z gonna cook for da duke himself! Betcha there's less fistfights in the palace, so's you can enjoy a meal from start to finish.~
@8204  = ~Hey, clear out. I don't need you meatheads roaming through my kitchen! *sigh* I wanna work somewhere where beer and blood aren't seasonings.~
@8205  = ~Bud, ya wanna hear a good joke? There were these three guys; one of 'em was a Cormyrian, another a Sembian... Hey! Where are ya going?~
@8206  = ~Plenty of other rooms for you, if you please. I've paid for mine in full and don't feel I should need to "double up," as it were.~
@8207  = ~It's most unneighborly of you to refuse to stay a neighbor. This was intended to be a private room when I purchased it. I certainly think the management shall be hearing about you.~
@8208  = ~All I can tell you is to avoid the Coast Way at all costs. The bandits have been growing more bold with each passing week. If you are going to travel along the road, don't trust anybody!~
@8209  = ~You must be the new servants and guards, well keep your place! It is an honor for you to be working here! Imagine, a Duchess overseeing such a transaction such as this in my own house. Surely this will turn my competitors absolutely green!~
@8210  = ~I know not who you are, but because of my guests, I will refrain from having you killed outright. I advise you to leave quickly lest I change my mind. I'll not tolerate strangers loitering about my house on such an occasion as this!~
@8211  = ~Guards! Murderers in my home! Kill them!~
@8212  = ~Guards! There are intruders in the mansion! To arms!~
@8213  = ~Welcome to the Low Lantern, my friends. I trust you will enjoy your stay, and sample much of our lively fare.~
@8214  = ~Oh, come now. Surely you can see the therapeutic benefits that come from the occasional "debauching." Suit yourself, but if you don't wish to participate, at least make sure not to disturb our other patrons. Feel free to help yourself to milk at the bar.~
@8215  = ~If you have come here simply to insult my patrons and I, I shall have to ask you to leave. If you are rich, however, we can provide a steady stream of "lowlifes" for you to belittle. It's rather a commonly sought service for some of our more "well-to-do" clientele, and apparently good for bolstering a poor self-image. Not that your actions suggest you have a poor self-image. No, that's not what I was implying at all. Good day.~
@8216  = ~Ah, yes, we do like to see our patrons enjoying themselves to the fullest. However, I should thank you very much to keep careful control of yourselves this eve. Anyone disrupting the recreation of our patrons is summarily removed by our private security. Just a friendly warning. Good eve.~
@8217  = ~Oh, indeed! We have patrons of every possible profession. I think it unlikely you'll find a more diverse collection of people peacefully collected in the same room. Not that we don't have our share of rabble-rousers, but we are well equipped to quickly quell any disturbance. Have a nice stay.~
@8218  = ~Oh, there is no distinction between classes here. The Low Lantern is quite the equalizer, and our patrons span much of the social spectrum. Of course, we might tend to "favor" the heavy tippers. Unintentionally of course. Enjoy your visit.~
@8219  = ~Quite well off? If that was a poorly veiled attempt to inquire as to the wealth of our patrons, let me save you some time. We have a number of visitors who tend to tip rather heavily, and to protect those customers, and everyone else, we employ a large number of guards. They stand ready to assist if a patron gets a touch rowdy, as well as to deal with any scoundrels that would attempt to "sample" the possessions of their fellow revelers. You are welcome to stay, but behave yourself. You'll be glad you did.~
@8220  = ~I trust everything is satisfactory? Please don't hesitate to leave if it is not.~
@8221  = ~Hello again. A pleasure having you here, to be sure.~
@8222  = ~I would not be caught dead in such a place of debauchery as this!~
@8223  = ~I should not be caught dead in such a place of debauchery as this!~
@8224  = ~You had better believe it! Woe to the fool who gets in the way of my fun tonight!~
@8225  = ~An excellent suggestion. This looks to be quite the popular place.~
@8226  = ~I'll be quite sure to sample as much as I please before I leave tonight. I imagine your clientele are quite well off?~
@8227  = ~I'll be quite sure to sample as much as I please before I leave tonight. I imagine your clientele are quite well off?~
@8228  = ~Oooo, cheeky! Watching is extra, sweetie.~
@8229  = ~I swear it's not what it looks like. I had this dream I did, where I was lost in a strange land. Frozen with fear I was, because I couldn't take more 'n two steps at a time. I lost my life to a ferocious rabbit, and a flock of people came from nowhere to steal my pants. And then I woke up here. Honest. Don't tell the missus.~
@8230  = ~Up for some company luv? No, I suppose not. Looks like you've your own "party" waiting. Some other life perhaps.~
@8231  = ~Ooo, such a pity for you, milady. You've arrived on Gunther's night off.~
@8232  = ~You didn't have to use that charm spell on me; I'm already hot for you, beautiful.~
@8233  = ~Sorry, milord, but my services have been reserved for the eve.~
@8234  = ~Ooo, darling, you're probably looking for Schvantz. He's hanging out around here somewhere.~
@8235  = ~A little while ago, darling, a man named Yago started renting out a room here every night. He became quite the regular. Lately though, he's become somewhat prone to violence. He's some sort of mage, so no one wants to deal with him. You're a great hero, darling. Why don't you take care of him?~
@8236  = ~That Sarevok seems a bit gruff at times, but perhaps that is what we need: a firm hand to guide us in these troubling times. I wonder, though...~
@8237  = ~Certainly you could have put more effort into your appearance before coming here. This is the event of the year and you look as though you wrestled the guard to get in. Shameful.~
@8238  = ~There's quite a few rumors going about. Most of them center about Sarevok. It's rather obvious that he'll be the next Grand Duke, but the real news is that he's thinking about war... against Amn.~
@8239  = ~It is quite the honor to be here on this occasion. That Sarevok is such a fine young man.~
@8240  = ~I had thought this function was invitation only. Who let rabble such as you in?~
@8241  = ~There's quite a few rumors going about. Most of them center about Sarevok. It's rather obvious that he'll be the next Grand Duke, but the real news is that he's thinking about war... against Amn.~
@8242  = ~Out out OUT! I'll no be giving out scraps to fools wandering about tonight! I've a DUKE to cook for, so if you try to distract me you'll likely get a pot upside your head!~
@8243  = ~Though I'm stuck in this here kitchen, it don't mean I haven't got rumors coming my way. From what I hear, Sarevok's the next Grand Duke fer sure.~
@8244  = ~Blacktalon Mercenary~
@8245  = ~There are many rumors going about at the party. Most people expect Sarevok to be the next Grand Duke. They also think that his first act as Duke will be to declare war on Amn.~
@8246  = ~Hello there. Trying to escape the party too, hmm? I simply find these functions utterly boring, but mother would never let me miss one. I don't like that Sarevok either. There's something about him... not right. Sounds like quite the ruckus out there, but it's still all so boring.~
@8247  = ~Oh! You startled me. Hiding from that boring party too, hmm? Me too. I barely even knew Duke Eltan, and there is just something not... right about that Sarevok. Wait— You don't look like the other guests. YOU SNUCK IN! HA! That is SO funny! Better go quick, though. The guard will have you quartered for being here.~
@8248  = ~Oh no, you're just asking for trouble now. Everything in here is trapped for sure. It might be funny if you got away with it, but if you don't you'll be hung out to dry like the servants do the laundry.~
@8249  = ~I DID warn you, didn't I? Better go quick now!~
@8250  = ~What are you— What are you doing? OH! You're a THIEF, aren't you?! That is SO funny! Mother would have an absolute fit to know you were here. Here, let me get this.~
@8251  = ~There. I TOLD them this lock was broken but they never listen to me. Go ahead and take it. This will probably cause quite the stir, but I really don't care. Anything to get talk off that awful Sarevok fellow. Better go now. Don't want them finding you here.~
@8252  = ~Ahhh! Guards! Mother!~
@8253  = ~You're still here? Fun's fun, but you should go quickly now.~
@8254  = ~That party still going on? It's a wonder they haven't all fallen asleep where they stand.~
@8255  = ~Keep quiet, you! You'll interrupt the proceedings!~
@8256  = ~Shh! Sarevok does not look the sort of person you would wish to interrupt.~
@8257  = ~This is a somber occasion. Kindly refrain from acting the boor.~
@8258  = ~Guards! Miscreants!~
@8259  = ~There's quite a few rumors going about. Most of them center about Sarevok. It's rather obvious that he'll be the next Grand Duke, but the real news is that he's thinking about war... against Amn.~
@8260  = ~other~
@8261  = ~neither~
@8262  = ~both~
@8263  = ~Such manners! And on such an occasion! Begone, you loutish fool.~
@8264  = ~Should not your attention be upon Sarevok? He is why we are all here, after all.~
@8265  = ~Something... something is amiss with that large man. Perhaps I have just caught a touch of a fever, but there is something...~
@8266  = ~Help! Such villainy!~
@8267  = ~There's quite a few rumors going about. Most of them center about Sarevok. It's rather obvious that he'll be the next Grand Duke, but the real news is that he's thinking about war... against Amn.~
@8268  = ~Heh... hehe... Well, welcome to ye! I trust ye are of fine health today? Come to do something about it? I f-f-find that most of the people above are a bit too healthy sometimes. Stay awhile and free your mind a bit...~
@8269  = ~I am sure you do. No matter. More of me for someone else...~
@8270  = ~Ooooo, you are waaaaay too healthy. Bet you spend most your nights buffing the helm, hmm? Off with you then, and don't come back until you've loosened your belt a little. Have a friend help, it's more fun that way. Heeeeheee.~
@8271  = ~Now don't get me wrong big... fella. Not that you're not attractive an all, but tonight I'm enjoying my own company. Stay awhile and relax for an eve. No pressures here.~
@8272  = ~Heeheeee... not that I'm a... Xena-phobe or anything, but... you're not my type, sister. Enjoy the eve, though.~
@8273  = ~Oooh, colors.~
@8274  = ~Your offer is tempting indeed, but I have obligations elsewhere.~
@8275  = ~Away from me, harlot! I'll not let your presence despoil me or my companions!~
@8276  = ~Why darling, is that a personal invitation?~
@8277  = ~Why darling, is that a personal invitation?~
@8278  = ~I'm too high to be of any use to you honey.~
@8279  = ~Off with ye! I'm waiting on a gentleman caller and I don't need you here spookin' him. He's... sensitive.~
@8280  = ~Mmmmm, hello there. Why don't you come back on a night when my schedule is clear? We'll talk... business.~
@8281  = ~Ooooo, hello honey. Why don't you come back on a night when my schedule is less crowded? We'll talk... business. I've been thinking of branching out into other service markets. You'd make a... mmmm... wonderful test audience.~
@8282  = ~I told ye I was busy! Now leave!~
@8283  = ~All I can tell you, lover, is to watch for Slythe and Krystin. They're crazy.~
@8284  = ~Don't ye look down on me when ye're walkin' past, ye knobbish plonker. We're all sellin' something; I'm just more obvious.~
@8285  = ~Bugger off, I don't want yer uppity self 'round here.~
@8286  = ~All I can tell you, lover, is to watch for Slythe and Krystin. They're crazy.~
@8287  = ~Hello hello. Feel free to eat, drink, and be merry, but kindly do so outside of my office. If ye wish to pay Low Lantern rates, then you'll warrant a warmer welcome. This is the Undercellar, however, and though our prospect be somewhat cheaper, my company is not. Have a pleasant stay.~
@8288  = ~I wouldn't be putting too much stock into all the rumors you hear about my little place. Any establishment that serves the clientele that I do is likely to inspire a few tales, though I'd appreciate you not adding fuel to the fire. Good eve to you.~
@8289  = ~I think you will find that speaking ill of the Undercellar is a good way to ruin your health. I take no interest in what my customers do here, and saying otherwise is a good way to get a face full of fist in a hurry. Get out, if you please.~
@8290  = ~I do not drink with customers. Our association is strictly formal, and any attempt to extend that relationship will be met with a quick trip to the door. I provide friends of a sort, but I am not one of them. Good day.~
@8291  = ~Take offense if you will, but also take it outside. I neither wish to know, nor associate, with any of the clientele. The best customer is an anonymous customer. Trying to be otherwise will likely get your name in the obituaries before it gets known here.~
@8292  = ~Save the manners for the harlots. You'll not endear yourself to me regardless, so don't even try. Goodbye.~
@8293  = ~It is a continuing annoyance to me that, because ANYONE is welcome in the Undercellar, they think anyone is welcome in my personal office. I ask you again to leave.~
@8294  = ~~
@8295  = ~~
@8296  = ~I hear there are some pretty shady dealings that go on down here. Do you condone such behavior?~
@8297  = ~I hear there are some pretty shady dealings that go on down here. Do you condone such behavior?~
@8298  = ~No need to get all uppity on me, sir. I didn't mean any harm. Just wanted to share a drink with the gracious host, is all.~
@8299  = ~I don't think you should speak in that kind of tone to guests! They might take offense. I might take offense!~
@8300  = ~Pardon my intrusion. I shall leave immediately.~
@8301  = ~Please, all of my girls are available for friends of mine. I must warn you to avoid Slythe and Krystin. They are crazies, and shouldn't be trifled with.~
@8302  = ~While at the Undercellar, we were warned to avoid Slythe and Krystin. Seems as if those two have put a scare into the denizens of this underground brothel.~
@8303  = ~Dark, dank, and oh so squalid. Mother would absolutely erupt if she saw me here. Such filth and degradation... I love it!~
@8304  = ~Dear and bother! I rather think my purse has been pinched. Not entirely unpleasant, but still...~
@8305  = ~Ooo, you look to be an entire theme party all to yourselves. I'll have to come back when I can afford you all.~
@8306  = ~Good friend, we should go about this brothel and try out everything it has to offer.~
@8307  = ~'Ere, fool! Step back a bit! You're crowding me.~
@8308  = ~I don't much care if you're happy to see me, as long as that's a pouch of coins.~
@8309  = ~Don't ye go messin' wit' these other hedge dollies. They don't know the business like I do.~
@8310  = ~Hey! Don't be scarin' away the marks, ye dirty cully<GIRLBOY>s!~
@8311  = ~Guards! Ye fools have let thieves into our midst!~
@8312  = ~Guards! Quickly! Murder!~
@8313  = ~All I can tell you, lover, is to watch for Slythe and Krystin. They're crazy.~
@8314  = ~Sorry, sweetheart, I've no time for play right now. Must pay off the boss man or I lose room privileges. Ah well, it's better than having no roof at all. Although I DO like watching the stars while I work. Can't have everything, I guess.~
@8315  = ~Off wit' you fruity fools, I've payments to make at Dillar's. Percentage of profits for use of the 'cellar, don't ye know.~
@8316  = ~Why do I get the feeling that where you're from, "bumping uglies" meant a head-butting contest? Out of my way, I've a money-grubbing manager to pay off.~
@8317  = ~All I can tell you, lover, is to watch for Slythe and Krystin. They're crazy.~
@8318  = ~Out of my kitchen! A late order means a sure shot to the gullet! Be a cold day indeed before I take a punch for loiterers like you!~
@8319  = ~Hey, friend, you don't think my butt's too big, do you? My wife keeps on telling me that I have to stop skimming the food when I'm cooking, but I don't see the point.~
@8320  = ~Hail and welcome. The bar and kitchen are at your disposal, but if you imbibe a bit too much, do mind the furniture. We replaced everything just last week after an unfortunate meeting between a patron's head and most of the fixtures. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8321  = ~Hmm? Hello. Mind you don't get stains in the rooms, as we don't clean them too terribly often. Not that you would be likely to... I mean... what I meant to say was... Ah, to the planes with it! Just try not to make trouble while here. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8322  = ~I expect you have the gold to be bothering me? Fine, stay as you will. Rest assured however, that if I find a single piece of cutlery missing I'll have you quartered while you sleep. This ain't no ultimate place to be stealing forks and spoons you know. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8323  = ~I know the Sturgeon be a damn sight cheaper than the Helm and Cloak, but I dinna think I would be sharing a room! Out ye get! I was here first!~
@8324  = ~Share my room as long as ya like, I love the extra company.~
@8325  = ~'Ere there, what do ye need to be bothering me for? I've work to do.~
@8326  = ~Ye drop another careless hand near me and I swears you'll lose it! Order up at the bar.~
@8327  = ~~

@8329  = ~I hear so much stuff each day it's hard to remember any of it later on.~
@8330  = ~Welcome, travelers. I trust you will keep your weapons with your wits and not provoke trouble while here? It's the best thing for everyone. You'll find that the majority of our customers are well equipped to defend themselves and, if need be, the bar as well. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8331  = ~Welcome ye are, at least till ye canna pay your tab. Beware you well the dark corners of the 'song, as the guard turn a blind eye to much that happens here. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8332  = ~Well, well, look what washed up outta the bilge. I'll warn you now, do what e'er you wish in here, but draw the attention of the city guard upon us and you'll be floatin' out to sea with nary a boat, let alone sail.~
@8333  = ~~
@8334  = ~~
@8335  = ~Good eve to you. I am Alyth, the owner and proprietor. I trust the Elfsong will fit your needs, whatever they should be. I should be wary of the clientele if I were you. Everyone is quite on edge as of late.~
@8336  = ~The Elfsong is somewhat of a refuge for the less appreciated members of society. You will find that the city patrols give us a wide berth, though we are not unprotected. Thievery is kept in check by the willingness of our patrons to answer with a blade, though I suppose this is successful just as often as it is not. We tend to go through a large number of customers, though we keep the smart ones.~
@8337  = ~We have lost more than the average citizen; we have lost the Lady. Often we are blessed by a strange phantom voice. It is an elvish maiden lamenting a lost love drowned at sea. Her voice is quite beautiful, and the reason I purchased this establishment in the first place. She has not uttered a note for nigh unto several tenday. Surely it is an omen of sorts, though I canna say of what. I would have thought the economic troubles of the land too paltry to affect the concerns of the dead, but matters are often more complicated than they seem. I suppose they are often simpler as well, though that truth does not support my argument quite as well. Forget I mentioned it. Enjoy your stay.~
@8338  = ~Your confidence is impressive, though it will prove a poor shield against the blows sure to come if you insist on continuing with that attitude. My tavern is as much a place for self-reflection as it is for shady deals and the hiring of killers. You will find that most of the regulars are not to be taken lightly. Watch your back against the stares of strangers.~
@8339  = ~~
@8340  = ~I do not wish to seem inhospitable, but I choose not to share your company. Leave me to my business.~
@8341  = ~Hello again. I trust you are finding my tavern to your liking? I do endeavor to sculpt it to the needs of all who frequent it.~
@8342  = ~Apart from looking a little haggard, everyone seems quite ordinary. What have I to fear here?~
@8343  = ~Why should melancholy be so pervasive here? Is there not an ill feeling throughout the Coast?~
@8344  = ~I have nothing to fear from this rabble. They will find themselves on MY edge for any threat posed.~
@8345  = ~I wish I could help you friend, but I have many problems of my own, not the least of which is the loss of our phantom singer.~
@8346  = ~'Allo, me friends. You've the look of the well-armed wanderer, which means you *burp* either do the fool's work of dungeon slumming or the easy labor of the blade-and-night man. Aye! Either way, you've items you've liberated from their previous owners. I can help you on that point. If you've something a touch too "known" for a store to buy, I'll take it off your hands—at a slightly reduced figure, of course.~

@8348  = ~Out o' me face, fool! I don't need your nose sniffin' about me business!~
@8349  = ~I doubt you'll get much in the way of conversation from anyone, what with the Lady not singin'. If that voice don't come back there are gonna be some men o' the deeps that'll never be the same.~

@8353  = ~Hello. I trust you'll be behaving yourselves while here? We are somewhat less tolerant of unruly guests than more... unrestrained neighboring Inns.~
@8354  = ~I'll tell you straight out: we do not cater to unruly guests, and if you disturb any of the other patrons, you will be asked to leave. If you press the matter, you will be "assisted" to the door. For the good of all concerned, I am sure you will not let it go that far.~

@8358  = ~A good day to you! No doubt you have heard of the Blushing Mermaid and sought it out. Seldom do people come here accidentally. It's sometimes a dangerous place to be. At least, it is without ample protection for your purse.~
@8359  = ~Welcome, you are. Just try not to make too many "messes" while here. We lose enough patrons to their professions without losing them to their recreation as well.~
@8360  = ~Welcome. Even scum such as yourselves are welcome here. Don't look so shocked at me, if ye canna withstand such a minor truth as that ye will surely leave here dead tonight. Besides, ye must be used to it by now.~
@8361  = ~~
@8362  = ~Lots more people at the tables since the shortage of iron began. Desperate losers out of work and hope. I'd be sad for them... but their pain puts food on my table. Roll up roll up, all's well at my house!~

@8368  = ~Here goes the money for horse feed. Gotta let it ride so I can too.~
@8369  = ~Merchant companies are turning out porters left and right. Not much choice aside from dockhand, and I've a bum shoulder. Lady Luck smile on a wayward soul tonight.~

@8371  = ~Back yerself off! This here's my table an' I'm on a streak! You interrupt me again and I'll have you for pig feed!~
@8372  = ~I warned ya, I did! You could'na leave it alone, could ya?! So be it! Get 'em!~
@8373  = ~Hey, bud, we should drop by the Undercellar and check out the fest girls. How 'bout it?~
@8374  = ~You look like the kinda person who has some money. How 'bout we go to the Low Lantern, and ya rent us a couple of girls fer the night?~
@8375  = ~I swear, if I don't make back my gold tonight... I'm off to the Undercellar. It's a humiliating way to make your money, but a girl's gotta eat.~
@8376  = ~You would think a few of those knotheads at the tables would make some room. Luck is a lady for a reason.~
@8377  = ~I'm in no mood to speak wit' you. That fool husband of mine lost our savings down to the last coin.~
@8378  = ~Pah! Gambling fools. Learn to heft a sword and you'll never go hungry. Especially in the Gate, where the alleys are always full of prey.~
@8379  = ~Maybe you handsome lads could give some money to a lady down on her times. We're good friends, ain't we?~
@8380  = ~Good eve. The Helm and Cloak stands ready to serve thee in a swift and relaxing manner. I trust you are aware that our provender is a touch more pricey than some of the "lesser respected" inns about town? This is true, though I have always maintained that you get what you pay for. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8381  = ~Hmm? Hello there. Welcome to the Helm and Cloak. Whilst here you may expect superior service and excellent quality. Er, you can PAY can't you? As long as this is so we shall be on excellent terms. Please try not to make trouble while here. We are well protected and all a ruckus will serve to do is disturb the other guests. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8382  = ~Oh, no, no, no. I rather think someone of your standards will not be comfortable in the Helm and Cloak at all. We pride ourselves on our somewhat expensive but relaxed fare, whereas you seem to be the sort who should enjoy the atmosphere of, say, the Blushing Mermaid. I am sorry to say it, but I did not mean that as a compliment. Best that you go now, for surely it will only mean trouble if you stay. Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8383  = ~Please do not distract me, good patron. I've orders to fill amongst the regulars.~
@8384  = ~You have been cursed with petrification.~
@8385  = ~Even though you're a good friend, I don't think you'd understand the highbrow political talk that I hear among the patrons. Please don't take insult my friend, it is hardly your fault that you were born into the world to such a lowly caste.~
@8386  = ~Frightfully sorry, but this room is off limits for the time being. No offense intended, you understand. It's just that we've a rather nervous guest who insists that their room be kept under strictest lock and key. Frightfully sorry, but you cannot pass.~
@8387  = ~I am afraid I shall have to ask you to step back. Please do so, as I can only give so many warnings before I must enforce my request. I must also remind you that the city guard always sides with house security in matters such as this, so any disturbance here will surely bring them out to assist.~
@8388  = ~You have all of a few seconds to step back! I cannot allow entry, and if you persist, I shall be forced to apply my blade! Please do not force the issue!~
@8389  = ~I have little alternative! Defend yourself!~
@8390  = ~You have one chance to leave this instant. Hesitate and you lose your head.~
@8391  = ~Enter as you please, good friend! I trust that you'll be no trouble.~
@8392  = ~Frightfully sorry, but you must have "mistakenly" entered the wrong room. Please make haste in your retreat, as I do not wish to make a fuss.~
@8393  = ~The Helm and Cloak provides excellent service and quiet atmosphere. I do not wish to repay the house by getting blood on their carpets and disturbing the other guests. To this end, I wish you to retreat from my room before I call the house guards.~
@8394  = ~By the planes, who the blazes are you?! Get out of my room!~
@8395  = ~I have no recourse! Guards!~
@8396  = ~Even though it is not decent for me to mingle with those beneath my station, I find that you possess a certain irresistible charm. I am willing to tell whatever you wish to hear. Perhaps you'd like to know about the last ball I attended. It was wondrous; I was at the forefront of everyone's mind.~
@8397  = ~Hello, milady. I trust you will find your stay at the Three Old Kegs to be as restful as any place ye have ever called home. Old Nantrin shall see to it. What do you need?~
@8398  = ~Hello, milord. I trust you will find your stay at the Three Old Kegs to be as restful as any place you have ever called home. Old Nantrin shall see to it.~
@8399  = ~You have the look of someone unaccustomed to the quiet life. Well, that is what we are all about here at the Three Old Kegs. If you are looking for otherwise you had best keep moving, because you won't find it here.~
@8400  = ~I tell you straight and true right now so there is no mistaking. This is a QUIET place, and those that wish to make it otherwise shall find themselves "escorted" to the door. If lucky, you will be able to continue on by yourself after.~
@8401  = ~I trust your stay will be a restful one. We serve as a refuge away from the hectic life on the road.~
@8402  = ~It's true we are well stocked if you wish a drink or two, but I would advise you not to overindulge. I should hate for our short acquaintance to end with me turning you out to the street.~
@8403  = ~I rather think that you are looking for fare a touch more lively than we offer. I might suggest the Blushing Mermaid as one alternative. They are somewhat lax in the area of house rules. Good day.~
@8404  = ~I mean this in the best possible sense with no offense intended, but if you lay a finger on my person I shall have to hand it back on a platter. Likely garnished with some mint and a sprig of parsley. Do enjoy your stay.~
@8405  = ~Flattering, though I think the Low Lantern might have staff more accommodating of your... needs. We cater more to the mature adventurer. It is up to you to decide whether you fit that description.~
@8406  = ~Boring to some perhaps, though I think our regulars find the comfort we provide as close to having a home as they can get. You are welcome to return when you tire of the sleepless nights the other inns provide.~
@8407  = ~There are plenty of establishments that offer what you seek, though I think you will find them no more relaxing than your journey to get there. Likely they will be no safer, either. When you tire of sleeping with one eye open, I think you will be back.~
@8408  = ~And your patronage will be most welcome. Business has unfortunately dwindled along with the traffic on the roads. We welcome new customers, especially when old ones cannot make the trek and leave the rooms vacant.~
@8409  = ~Eh, we DO have regulars that have prolonged stays, so you may not be able to stay for an extended period. You are welcome in the short term though.~
@8410  = ~Please do not disturb me now, I am not in the mood. One of our regulars has left town without paying her tab. It's not often we lose a customer in such a manner.~
@8411  = ~By the planes, this is just what I need! Roll up the kegs! It's time to unwind!~
@8412  = ~By the planes, this is just what I need! Roll up the kegs! It's time to unwind!~
@8413  = ~And what of you? You look to be quite the lusty wench; how about you serve as my refuge away from the ugly faces of my fellows?~
@8414  = ~And what of you? You look to be quite the lusty wench; how about you serve as my refuge away from the ugly faces of my fellows?~
@8415  = ~It sounds dreadfully boring. Perhaps I shall seek more lively fare elsewhere.~
@8416  = ~It dost sound dreadfully boring. Perhaps I shall seek more lively fare elsewhere.~
@8417  = ~At last I have a place for quiet reflection at adventure's end. I shall look forward to a long, relaxing stay.~
@8418  = ~At last I have a place for quiet reflection at adventure's end. I shall look forward to a long, relaxing stay.~
@8419  = ~I must ask you not to disturb me, as I have many financial matters that now occupy my attention.~
@8420  = ~You may call me Ithtyl, good friend. I am glad to know one so lively and entertaining as you. Why don't you head downstairs and enjoy yourself? Take these 20 gold, so that you may afford whatever takes your fancy to buy.~
@8421  = ~How dare you barge into my room?! I will have you leave at once!~
@8422  = ~Wait!~
@8423  = ~Perhaps... perhaps you are the type of people who can help me. I am in need of someone to... perform a service for me. I need someone... removed.~
@8424  = ~This scoundrel is no innocent! He threatens to ruin my life with... with the spreading of... accusations. He threatens to ruin my reputation and standing unless I pay him an exorbitant sum almost weekly! I beg of thee... you must help me.~
@8425  = ~Yes, well perhaps some other time then. Whenever you can fit me into your schedule. It's not as though this would be urgent! Begone!~
@8426  = ~If such is your decision, then so be it. Leave me to my misery! Get out!~
@8427  = ~Thank you indeed! His name is Cyrdemac and he frequents the Elfsong Tavern. I have not been there myself, but I hear it is quite a rough place. You could do the deed in the main bar itself and likely none would call the guards. I know not if he will have friends with him though. Thank you for this. Upon your return I shall pay you 500 gold. A small price to have this embarrassment removed.~
@8428  = ~Have you... have you done it? Is he...?~
@8429  = ~Please hurry. The longer this continues the more likely it is he will find out.~
@8430  = ~You are very blunt, though I suppose that is to be expected. If gold is that much of a concern for you, you shall have it in abundance. I shall pay you 2,000 gold for your trouble. His name is Cyrdemac, and he frequents the Elfsong Tavern. I have heard it is a rough place, and one could likely commit the deed even in the main room with nary a guard called. Please hurry.~
@8431  = ~Certainly. I shall double the offer if you so wish it. 4,000 gold for your trouble. Is that acceptable now?~
@8432  = ~I am no bloodthirsty monster. What use would I have for such a grisly trophy? Just do the job and leave all his parts at the scene.~
@8433  = ~Oh, that is just perfect. Wonderful! All that is left is to pay you for your trouble.~
@8434  = ~Indeed. Here is your coin. Our business is concluded, so I trust you will withdraw as soon as possible. It would not do for me to be seen consorting with a known killer. Good day.~
@8435  = ~What?! You are no better than— I suppose I should have seen it in your eyes when we first met. It would seem I was better off with the devil I knew. Very well, there is little I can do to stop you. I shall be here promptly every two days.~
@8436  = ~Oh, that is just perfect. Wonderful! All that is left is to pay you for your trouble. I fear that I am unable to give you the money I promised, however. Please forgive me, but I was desperate and you seemed so preoccupied with the gold. I figured that I must offer a large sum to get the deed done. I apologize, but I have just 500 gold to give you.~
@8437  = ~You may demand all you wish, but it will do you no good. I simply do not have the gold I promised. The 500 I have offered is the most I can give. I am sorry.~
@8438  = ~What bounties are currently unclaimed?~
@8439  = ~It is not time for your pickup yet, and I'll not suffer your company otherwise. Get out!~

@8450  = ~The fiend! He'll be a day's journey down before he knows he's dead! Where can he be found?~

@8474  = ~I trust you mean Areana? I would not have thought her capable of hiring someone to kill me, especially of such a trite issue as this. A simple tryst in the Undercellar and she is prepared to pay me for weeks on end. The nobles are such prudes when it comes to one of their number slumming with a common sneaksman. No matter. I will kill you, and then I shall double how much I demand.~
@8475  = ~A mutual friend? Areana? She hired you to come and talk to me? No, you are too heavily armed for mere chitchat. Let me guess; you were to kill me but you want a peaceful solution. You would rather end this diplomatically and save your conscience the trouble of killing someone over a mere tryst in the Undercellar. Let me save you from your dilemma... and get in the first shot!~
@8476  = ~Merchandise? I see. Well, it has been a slow night for business. Let's go have a look at what you have. This way.~
@8477  = ~So, what do you have to interest me?~

@8534  = ~Many a story have I collected from across this great realm, though sometimes I am at a loss whether to believe them or not, due to their extraordinary circumstance. Such a tale is this, wherein lies the story of a band of hearty adventurers moving amidst the shadows of the land, effecting change where it is needed. I was enjoying the simple fare of the celebrations in Nashkel, when the strangest news hit the town. It would seem the mines, long plagued by unexplained deaths, had been inundated by a horde of ill-mannered kobolds, under the direction of a rather unscrupulous and hygienically suspect cleric of Cyric. Dispatching of the villain with appropriate brevity, the heroes freed the mine, and are the sole reason for the trickle of iron finally winding its way to the Gate now. None seem to recall their names, but the consensus agrees they were great of stature, and cut an impressive figure across the plains.~
@8535  = ~Stranger tales I have told, but none are as fresh in my mind as this one, which is also fresh from the happening as well! It would seem that the orchestrators of the ever vexing iron shortage supplied themselves and their allies with ore mined from a secret location, and while the coast was in turmoil they built quite the power base at the aforementioned mine. A group of heroes, for they can only be called such, lay siege to the encampment and ultimately flooded out the evil conspirators in a rushing torrent of water and justice, though not before securing the release of some several dozen enslaved workers. A serious blow, I am sure, to whatever fiendish plot is brewing in our fair land.~

It would seem that the orchestrators of the ever vexing iron shortage supplied themselves and their allies with ore mined from a secret location, and while the coast was in turmoil they built quite the power base at the aforementioned mine. A mysterious group of battle-veteran strangers, for I hesitate to call them heroes, lay siege to the encampment and ultimately flooded out the evil conspirators in a rushing torrent of water and justice, though every slave to the man was lost in the drenching. 'Twould seem they didn't wish to encumber themselves, though I imagine the weight of those dead souls must be nigh unto horrific. The question to pose then, is whether the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. We shall wait and see what comes of this.~
@8537  = ~Some tales defy all logic or explanation when posed to the sane mind, and it is a story just so that I give to you now. Much of it is already known, due to the celebrity of those involved, though many may find it truly shocking how deep the seeds of destruction were sewn. Beloved Sarevok, a man among men, set to all but rule the coast, was actually a core architect of the very iron shortage that so unraveled the economy of the land, and had a hand in the poisoning of Duke Eltan that directly led to his rise to power. We were but seconds away from the first step down that path when from the shadows again stepped the unknown group of my previous tales. None can say definitively what happened next, though it is certain that Sarevok was pursued to the very bottom of the Undercity, and from there he did not return. I'll wager many would just as soon have seen him chased to the ninth plane itself, as he hurt many of the folk of the land, both direct and indirect.~

@8539  = ~You there! State your business, but don't move from where you stand! I don't want to have to sic the boys on you!~
@8540  = ~No? Good then. Sorry for the rough greeting, but it has surely been slow digging with bandits harassing us nightly. Charleston Nib, at your service.~
@8541  = ~Then stay your course and continue on! We don't want an audience!~
@8542  = ~Well, if you put it like that... drop your weapons, boys. We don't want any dying here today. The dig is important, but it's not worth our lives. What do you thieving scum intend for us now?~
@8543  = ~Big words, but I don't think ye have the muscle to back them up! We've many a strong back here, and I think we know enough to take care of the likes of you!~
@8544  = ~Our trouble is no concern of yours... though if you must know, yes. Hmmm... would you perhaps be mercenaries? If you wish to earn an honest coin, mayhaps you would help guard our placement. We need only keep it secure a while longer, as we near the goal of our search.~
@8545  = ~Have we? Aye, and plenty of it. Nary an eve goes by without us losing another hand to the night. I swear, if we could just get a few moments of uninterrupted digging done... say, you wouldn't be willing to do a little service for me, would you? You could do a lot worse than working for ol' Charleston Nib.~
@8546  = ~You are partially right, though it's not a tomb, but an ancient settlement. It is also all that remains of a primitive race long since extinct, and we know little about their culture save that they seem to have destroyed themselves in war. Perhaps today we will learn something more. We are just about to break through into an inner chamber, perhaps the dwelling of the village shaman himself. Mayhaps you could be of assistance to us? We need but keep the camp secure a short while longer. Your very presence would probably dissuade anyone from attacking us, though I do not know the force behind our misfortune. They seem to take great pleasure in minor sabotage and kidnapping, though some of the missing men may have just run off from fear. Nothing is ever stolen, which is odd for bandits, but they must still be the cause. Will you help us?~
@8547  = ~No need to be that way. Off you go then, and let us get about our work.~
@8548  = ~I dare say that what we are attempting here is more than mere looting! It's a quest for knowledge and history, and if you have no appreciation for such things, I would suggest you leave as soon as possible. You will find little here to please your mercenary sensibilities.~
@8549  = ~A common criminal! Fine! Collect what e'er gold you can off us, but 'tis certain to be very little. We've restocked the camp thrice over because of sabotage, so we've no great wealth here. As for what we are guarding, we've no idea what we are to find; neither does it matter to us whether it's valuable or not. We are on a quest for knowledge. Move along now that you have your petty earnings. Leave us to our toil.~
@8550  = ~Aye! Scurry back under what e'er rock you crawled out from! Leave us to our honest work!~
@8551  = ~Have at them, men! Drive off these fools!~
@8552  = ~We have little to offer, but would 50 gold suffice? It's all we can give, what with having to restock our camp thrice over. Damnable saboteurs! Your mere presence may be enough to discourage our mystery assailants. Are ye up for it? It would only be for a short while.~
@8553  = ~Gracious we are! Now we stand a chance of completing the most exciting day of our dig! We're going to try for an entire new room today, possibly the shaman or chieftain quarters! We could find any number of relics within. Move amongst the men as you will, as your presence will no doubt reassure them.~
@8554  = ~But... as you wish. Perhaps we can scrape another 50 gold together, but it means that we MUST be done today. Is 100 gold total satisfactory?~
@8555  = ~Success! We are about to enter the last remaining room! It's sure to be the shaman's abode!~
@8556  = ~A good question, young man. I would guess that we are the first people to walk this room in nearly five thousand years. The very gods of Netheril would have been young at that time.~
@8557  = ~~
@8558  = ~I... I think I can explain the madness that overcame my men. They seemed to scream in some ancient tongues, but I recognize the word "Kozah." It's the name of an ancient power, the name of a god of Pandemonium. The tribe that lived here must have worshipped Kozah and the destruction he brought. The artifact that lies within this stone sarcophagus must be what has caused all of this bloodshed. Surely that artifact is cursed beyond belief! We should let it lie within this tomb forever. It's best that it never see the light of day.~

@8569  = ~Apology noted, though not accepted. I do not take kindly to being threatened. Good day.~
@8570  = ~Wary of bandits, are you? Must be digging up something pretty valuable, eh? Looting an old tomb perhaps?~
@8571  = ~Now that you are disarmed, we can talk civilized. I'm no thief, and I'm certainly no friend of any bandits! Maybe I can be of some help to you. Have you been having much trouble?~
@8572  = ~I have no wish to harm any of you, but you are obviously guarding something valuable. I suggest you hand it over, along with any gold on your persons.~
@8573  = ~I intend to simply move on. I only wished to see you humbled, since your greeting was so rude. Goodbye.~
@8574  = ~Whoa there! I didn't want to cause any trouble! Let's all put our weapons down and talk about this! Perhaps I can help with your problem!~
@8575  = ~Whoa there! I didn't want to cause any trouble! Let's all put our weapons down and talk about this!~
@8576  = ~So be it! We'll run you all through and take what we wish!~

@8578  = ~I am NO mercenary! Your offer is an insult! Goodbye!~
@8579  = ~What is the object of your search? Can there be anything of value in such a decrepit ruin? Seems little more than an abandoned tomb.~
@8580  = ~I'm always on the lookout for a bit o' spare cash. How much are we talking about?~
@8581  = ~I've no interest in doing you any favors... but if the price were right, I might be "persuaded."~
@8582  = ~I would like to know just what I would be protecting. What are you doing here? Looks to be glorified graverobbing in nothing but a decrepit tomb.~
@8583  = ~I'll not aid any two-bit tomb-robbers!~
@8584  = ~It would be an honor to help you learned people in your quest for knowledge.~
@8585  = ~What would be in it for me? Knowledge is well and good, but I have bills to pay.~
@8586  = ~Sorry, but I see very little here to interest me. My time is best spent elsewhere.~
@8587  = ~Such paltry coin is not worth my time! Raise your offer or I am leaving!~
@8588  = ~Such paltry coin is not worth my time! Raise your offer or I am leaving!~
@8589  = ~I have changed my mind. Keep your problems and your dig. I am leaving.~

@8593  = ~Why, hello there. Could we just step aside a moment and have a little chat away from prying ears?~
@8594  = ~~
@8595  = ~First, my name is Gallor. Second, we never had this conversation. I'm the "partner" of that old mister Charleston you met, except I'm none too thrilled about the non-profit aspects of the whole thing. The old man seems to think we should donate all our findings to some museum, whereas I am ever so much more practical. I should think certain people would pay dearly for the magical treasure we are about to unearth, and if they would be so eager, who are we to stand in their way? I would like you to steal the item and "remove" Mr. Nib from my little equation. You up to the task?~
@8596  = ~Blast you! You are playing just as safe as the old man! So be it; I will find other means to acquire a fair measure of profit from this fiasco! Best you continue on whatever errand you be on.~
@8597  = ~Old Mister Nib would never admit it, but that is mainly because he doesn't wish to jinx the dig. From what I could decipher in the ancient writings, the final room contains "the plate that provides bounty, leading food unto god." Doesn't take a genius to figure out what that means. Obviously, the item under all that dirt and rubble is enchanted such that it "provides bounty." Whether it's through increased crops or good hunting, I care not. Regardless, an object of that age and enchantment should command a hefty price and I intend to see that it does. You can be a part of it if you wish.~
@8598  = ~I care not whether the primitives who lived here worshipped chickens and the plate produces fodder! It does not matter! What DOES matter, is that we potentially have an item associated with a god long since lost to the mists of time. Its former enchantments may not even work, but it will still command an exorbitant price from a historian or collector. Do you wish a piece of the pie or don't ya?~
@8599  = ~Consider a payment of 900 gold. Would that be to your liking? Not a bad price for the heads of an old man and his dirty hired ditch-diggers. What say you?~
@8600  = ~Excellent, but just you make sure you do not attack them until AFTER they have breached the inner sanctum. It's unlikely you could uncover the item without their help. I will meet with you here after the deed to make our exchange. Remember to get everyone! I will be the sole survivor to tell the tale.~
@8601  = ~Excellent, but best that you hurry back to the camp. They were just about to breach the inner sanctum when I left, and it would be best to take care of them before a runner is dispatched with the news. I will meet with you here after the deed to make our exchange. Remember to get everyone! I will be the sole survivor to tell the tale.~
@8602  = ~You fool! Charleston and his men are not dead! How am I to blame the theft of the item on bandits if they are alive to say otherwise?! Finish the task or you get nothing from me!~
@8603  = ~Well... it's done and done. Here is your 900, and here is my beauty. Hmm... it's not quite as I had expected, but no matter. I have it to myself, and that is all that matters. I shall concoct a tragic story of an expedition hijacked by bandits, with all hands lost and payrolls stolen... strange... it is warm to the touch... Leave me now, our business is done.~

Would you care for a story this eve?~
@8641  = ~No? Suit yourself, if that is what you wish. It is a shame though; it is my bardic credos to entreat the ears of whomever I meet. If you do change your wish, I am certain to be in the area for some time. Rich with stories it is...~

The money you have received from Tranzig should cover your usual fee. Your assignment is a difficult one, but I'm sure that you are up to the task. There is a group of mercenaries who should be coming through Nashkel in the next few days. They are led by a whelp named <CHARNAME>. You are to kill <CHARNAME>, and all that travel with <PRO_HIMHER>. I warn you; they might not look like much, but they are very dangerous. Good hunting!

Tazok~
@8914  = ~Tazok,
I hope that everything moves along smoothly. I have written to give you instructions from our superiors. I have been told that a small band of mercenaries might cause the Iron Throne some trouble in the future. You are to ensure that they don't live to upset our operations. Obtain the services of the assassin Nimbul. He should serve you well.

Davaeorn~
@8915  = ~Tazok,
I have noticed that your shipments of iron have slowed of late. It is imperative that we receive another ton of ore. Step up your raids, and get a shipment to our base in Cloakwood within the next week. We need to stockpile as much ore as possible before our ultimatum is given. Also, Sarevok wants to know what has happened with the band of mercenaries. Have they been killed? You had better ensure that they have been, as Sarevok will not take kindly to any other news.

Davaeorn~
@8916  = ~Rieltar,
My superiors are intrigued by your proposal. I would like to discuss it further, but not through correspondence such as this. The Harpers and Zhents have been very active in this region of late; it would be very unfortunate if they tried to disrupt an alliance between our two organizations. If you, Brunos, and Thaldorn were to meet with us in the safety of Candlekeep, my superiors would be much relieved. Please send a response ASAP.

Tuth~
@8917  = ~Father,
I received your letter, and I can assure you that the mercenaries led by <CHARNAME> will no longer trouble our operations. I have dealt with them personally. Before dying, they were most forthcoming in their revelations. It is as you had surmised: They were agents of the Zhentarim. I am also writing to tell you that I cannot attend the meeting at Candlekeep. Some problems have arisen with the Chill and the Blacktalons. They have had trouble working with each other, and I am needed there to smooth over any dissension. I am sorry that I will not be at your side.

Sarevok~
@8918  = ~Diary

14th of Eleint, 1365: Today Cormyr has instituted a ban against the Iron Throne from operating within their borders. While this is a great blow to the Iron Throne, it is the perfect opportunity for Rieltar to approach the Throne high council with his proposal. If things go well, we could begin the operation within the year.

25th of Marpenoth, 1365: Davaeorn has sent a message to Rieltar, informing him that the mine at Cloakwood has been drained and is ready for use. This revelation should help greatly in convincing the Throne high council.

2nd of Nightal, 1365: The Iron Throne council has agreed to support Rieltar's plan. He has been given all the resources he needs, as well as leadership of the project. I have expressed interest to my "father," and he has promised to include me within the operations along the Sword Coast. He mentioned Mother in our conversation: how I wasn't to be unfaithful to him as she had. He made it clear that I would suffer her fate if I was. His threats are weak and hollow, and I shall listen to them for only so long. I have decided to take this time to make my visit to Candlekeep. I have waited a long time to research the prophecies of Alaundo, and I must know if the dreams speak the truth. I will not believe the words of phantoms without proof, and the priest of Bhaal I confronted gave me nothing. He was old and died quickly in my grasp. If the words are true, I shall surely groom stronger acolytes than this.

11th of Ches, 1366: My research has gone well. The monks here at Candlekeep have been quite helpful. From what I have read, it would seem certain that the blood of Bhaal does indeed flow through my veins. His prophecies are (of course) ambiguous, but I think I understand them. He foresaw his coming death, and seeded his essence across the land. The children born as a result bear the marks of chaos, have power with no direction, and shall feel the blood of a god within them. The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise. It does not explicitly say, but obviously this means that death wrought by the children will cause them to ascend. Fitting, and since the father was the Lord of Murder, proving one's worth must involve an act in accordance with his portfolio. I begin to see what I must do. Death on a god-like scale.

3rd of Tarsakh, 1366: The monk Gorion troubles me. He seems to have taken an interest in my readings. I must be careful to be more clandestine in my research. I wish I could simply kill him, but I doubt I could safely murder him within this damnable library.

11th of Tarsakh, 1366: I had a dream this night. My mother was talking to me, but as she did her face became bloated and discolored. Her voice became weaker as she spoke to me, telling me to save her from Rieltar. I could see the garrote cutting into her neck, but I did nothing. It was only a dream. 

27th of Tarsakh, 1366: I take my leave of Candlekeep now, and not a moment too soon, for I am sure that Gorion has perceived my heritage. One thing that I am certain of: <CHARNAME> is, in actuality, one of Bhaal's brood as well. <CHARNAME> has all the markings, and it would explain Gorion's curiosity in my studies. Though there is nothing I can do now, I will have to make certain to return and kill the little brat. It would be foolish of me to let one of my siblings live, especially one being brought up by the Harpers (and I am sure that is where Gorion's allegiances lie).

5th of Mirtul, 1366: Today I met with Rieltar in Baldur's Gate. The fool still insists on calling me his son, and for now I will let him. He assumes that I am loyal to him because he raised me. Well, loyal I am, but only as long as he is useful. He's set up a base in the mansion of a destitute noble family and says that everything is running smoothly. Mulahey has established himself at the mines of Nashkel, and his kobold minions should be already busily contaminating the iron ore. Only a few slaves have begun to mine out the ore at Cloakwood, though Rieltar assures me that once the bandit raids begin we'll have a steady supply of new slaves.

8th of Hammer, 1367: I met with the leaders of the Chill and Blacktalons. I have little liking for Ardenor, the leader of the Chill, but Taurgosz seems to be a man of his word. It is a good thing, as I'll have to work with these mercenaries for the rest of the year.

3rd of Tarsakh, 1368: Everything proceeds well. The ore coming from Nashkel has started to deteriorate, and my mercenaries have been doing a fine job of destroying any iron caravans on route to Baldur's Gate. Though some of my mercenaries have been captured, most think they work for the Zhents, so no trouble has fallen on the Iron Throne. I am sure that the Zhents at Darkhold won't be pleased to know that their name has been falsely used. I will have to be wary for Zhentish agents in the coming months.

28th of Tarsakh, 1368: I think I now have the time to deal with that old codger Gorion, and his little whelp. I will have to inform my men that I'll be gone for the next few weeks.

No time to write, but I must not neglect my journals so. The future dead must know of how the Lord of Murder again came to them. I shall hire a scribe when time allows. Things have not gone completely as I have planned, but I will still be able to salvage the situation. <CHARNAME> is on the move to Baldur's Gate; if I could maneuver the whelp to Candlekeep, then I would have the perfect scapegoat for my plan. My mortal "father," Rieltar, is there to meet with the Knights of the Shield. He has been blocking all my attempts to escalate the hostilities between Amn and Baldur's Gate, and these meetings will only serve to smooth relations. I must rid myself of them all and assume control of the Iron Throne myself. I cannot allow petty business and monetary concerns to interfere. Terribly sorry, "Father," but my true parentage calls and you are in my way. I shall be sure to instruct the doppelgangers in the exact manner Rieltar should die. I think a garrote would be perfect for the task.

This diary looks to be important. You should probably keep it on your person.~
@8919  = ~Sarevok,
I have received your letter and am quite overjoyed by your proposition. I have told my wife, and she is as excited as I am. I accept your mission and think that your payment is very adequate. This will be our greatest feat yet! To kill three Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate! We will be arriving in Baldur's Gate within a week, and should be taking up our usual residence at the Undercellar. If you wish to contact us, you will find us there. Use the access points through the sewers.

Joyfully yours,
Slythe~
@8920  = ~Sarevok,
I must say that our first victim was not the challenge that my wife and I had expected. The foppish idiot had only the most token of defenses. However, I can assure you that Entar screamed quite deliciously all the way to the end. I hope that this next mission is much more difficult; from what you have told me, it would seem to be. Assassinating two Grand Dukes in their own palace, while they harangue the high nobles of Baldur's Gate no less! I can't wait! You still know where to find us. You should come down and enjoy the pleasures of the Undercellar for yourself; but if I know you, that'll never happen.

Your obedient servant,
Slythe~
@8921  = ~Slythe,
The time to strike is now. When the party commences on the night of my coronation, you will join up with my doppelganger assassins at the sewer entrance to the palace. You are to insinuate yourself into the crowd in the ballroom. When I have finished my speech, you will strike. If you aren't there, my doppelgangers will proceed without you, and your payment will be forfeit. Make sure to keep a leash on your little bitch of a wife. An invitation to the party is included with this note.

Sarevok

(This looks to be an important note, one that you should hold on to.)~
@8922  = ~Prat,
My schemes have come together in a most satisfying manner. The mercenaries who have plagued my every step are now imprisoned, accused with the murder of Rieltar, Brunos, and Thaldorn. Learn as much as you can about the fate of the mercenaries and then meet me back at Baldur's Gate. I apologize for leaving you here alone, but it was necessary to return to the city so as to take Rieltar's position as chief of operations. If things proceed smoothly I will be a Grand Duke within a few weeks.

Sarevok~
@8923  = ~Shalak,
I am glad to hear that you were successful in disposing of Zorl. With his identity you should be able to infiltrate more of your kindred into the Merchants' League Estate. Kill Irlentree as soon as possible and then that fop Aldeth.

Your Friend~
@8924  = ~Shalak,
As long as Aldeth lives he is a great threat to all of us. He is friends with the mercenaries who have been stirring up so much trouble in the south. If he were to confide his fears with them, it could be disastrous. Kill him, soon!

Your Friend~
@8925  = ~Shalak,
It pleases me that you now count Irlentree among your number, but you must kill Aldeth Sashenstar. He is a foppish dilettante, with no skill and little intellect. It confuses me that you have not killed him yet; have your skills withered? Write back soon—when you have killed Aldeth.

Your Friend~
@8926  = ~Kizska,
I must commend you for a job well done. Without your careful ministrations, Eltan would have remained my most potent foe. I must now ask for another favor. Some of your brethren are gathering at the sewer entrance to the palace; they are preparing to assassinate Grand Duchess Liia Jannath and Grand Duke Belt. I need you to assist them in their efforts, for you are the craftiest of your kind. This is the moment I have long waited for, as I hope you have as well. The bloodshed that will result when I declare war on Amn will be most glorious. Meet Krystin and Slythe at the Undercellar; they are my best assassins. There are many access points to the Undercellar through the sewers.

@9529  = ~That Tranzig fellow, he's a strange one. Always leaving town in the middle of the night and coming back in the morning. He thinks no one notices, but come on! With everyone so paranoid, it's impossible to go 'bout unnoticed.~
@9530  = ~Lot o' the people here in town are scared. The mines to the east haven't been doing too well. Some good men have died in 'em, left some really sad widows. Some say there's some sort of monstrous infestation in dem mines.~
@9531  = ~That arrogant bastard! You hear 'bout the mayor of Beregost? Kelddath came down here and told us we better stop shipping such bad iron. As if we can do anything about it!~
@9532  = ~Business is on the wane today, what with the fair just east of town.~
@9533  = ~If the mine production slows any more, we'll all be in the poorhouse.~
@9534  = ~Beware the woods to the west friend, for I hear tell of ogres and madmen.~
@9535  = ~Volo's blasted review cut my business in half! I'll take him for a chat out back when next I see him!~
@9536  = ~I hear that Amn's behind all those bandits in the south. People round here have been talking about how Amn and the Zhents are in league together. It makes me worry about what kinda things they could be scheming.~
@9537  = ~With iron being so scarce, I don't see how the Flaming Fist is gonna continue to be an effective police force. No new weapons and no new armor; not a good thing.~
@9538  = ~The Seven Suns has been acting very strange as of late. The company seems to be intent on losing money. Even a simple bartender like myself can see the foolishness of some of their decisions. I doubt the Iron throne is crying about it though, they're making a lot of inroads because of the Suns' mistakes.~
@9539  = ~I heard that the Merchants' League is having a lot of trouble. Seems that the three owners are squabbling about how to run the place. The Iron Throne's been taking advantage of that situation. If things continue as they are, the Throne soon won't have any competition. Kinda strange considering they only moved into the city a couple of years back.~
@9540  = ~I hear there's rumors of Shadow Thieves here in Baldur's Gate. I dunno if it's true, but if it is, I betcha they're here to scout out for an Amnian invasion.~
@9541  = ~Ever since the Iron Throne moved into that manse in the southwest, strange things have been afoot. I don't know what it is about that building, but it gives me the creeps.~
@9542  = ~With Entar Silvershield dead, they're going to have to elect a new Grand Duke. Seems like a lot of people think it'll be the new leader of the Iron Throne, Sarevok.~
@9543  = ~In the coming election, I think that that Sarevok lad is gonna take it. He has a lot of support from the nobility, and they're the ones with the clout.~
@9544  = ~I keep on hearing a lot about a military buildup. Angelo, the new commander of the Fist, has been sending a lot of the Fist down south to Beregost. I fear a war might be brewing.~
@9545  = ~It's really sad about Eltan. I hope he recovers from his illness; he was the most beloved of the Grand Dukes.~
@9546  = ~I still can't believe that Entar Silvershield was killed. From what's been being said, all the evidence points to the Shadow Thieves, and thus to Amn itself. Tymora help us all.~
@9547  = ~Everyone seems to be dropping dead these days. First Entar Silvershield, then Eltan gets sick, and now Scar's dead. Something's brewing, and it's nothin' good.~
@9548  = ~Did you hear about the assassinations at Candlekeep? Seems that the leaders of the Iron Throne went and got themselves killed. Those same people who helped the folks down in Nashkel did the deed. They were Amnian agents, I hear. Anyhow, one of the dead guys' son is now the leader; Sarevok is his name I think.~
@9549  = ~There's a big price on the heads of those folks who offed the Iron Throne's leaders. 5,000 gold or more I think.~
@9550  = ~HUMANS: Humans are the predominant race in Faerun. Humans rule most of the significant empires and kingdoms in the Realms. They are the most social and tolerant of races, excepting perhaps the halflings. Humans may advance as any class and are also the only race that can dual-class. Humans may not multi-class.~
@9551  = ~DWARVES: Dwarves are short and stocky, easily identifiable by their size and shape. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair. Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work and care little for most humor. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, but most of all, they love gold. Dwarves have a natural resistance to magic and poison. They possess infravision, which allows them to see in the dark. They gain a bonus to their constitution, but incur a penalty to their charisma and dexterity. There are four racial divisions of dwarves within the Realms: shield dwarves, gold dwarves, wild dwarves, and duergar.~
@9552  = ~ELVES: Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing, frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. Elves have a natural resistance to charm and sleep magics. They can see in the dark with infravision, and they are very skilled in the use of the bow and long sword. They have a bonus to their dexterity, but incur a penalty to their constitution. There are six racial divisions of elves within the Realms: gold elves, moon elves, wild elves, sea elves, dark elves (drow), and winged elves (avariel).~
@9553  = ~GNOMES: Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Most have dark tan or brown skin, white hair, and rather large noses. Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a love for nature that is only matched by their love for gems and jewelry. Gnomes have natural resistance to magic. They can see in the dark with infravision. They gain a bonus to their intelligence scores, but incur a penalty to their wisdom. There are two racial divisions of gnomes within the realms: rock gnomes and deep gnomes (svirfneblin).~
@9554  = ~HALFLINGS: Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad, and often quite florid. Their hair is typically curly, and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun tales. Halflings are highly resistant to poisons and magic. They are naturally skilled with slings as weapons, and have a limited ability to see in the dark. They receive a bonus to their dexterity, and incur a penalty to their strength. There are three racial divisions of halflings within the Realms: the hairfoot, tallfellow, and stout.~
@9555  = ~HALF-ELVES: Half-elves are a mix of human and elven blood. They are handsome folk, with good features from each of their parent races. A half-elf has the curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition of their human ancestors, and the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of their elven ancestors. Half-elves have a limited resistance to charm and sleep spells. They can see in the dark with infravision.~
@9556  = ~FIGHTER: Fighters are champions, swordmasters, soldiers, and brawlers who live or die by their knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. Good fighters need to be strong and healthy if they hope to survive.~
@9557  = ~RANGER: Rangers are warriors and woodsmen who are skilled with weapons and are knowledgeable in the ways of the forest. They often protect and guide lost travelers and honest peasant-folk. Rangers need to be strong and wise to the ways of nature to live a full life.~
@9558  = ~PALADIN: Paladins are warriors bold and pure, the exemplars of everything good and true. Like fighters, paladins are persons of action and combat. However, paladins live for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry. They strive to be a living example of these virtues so that others may learn from them as well as gain by their actions.~
@9559  = ~CLERIC: Clerics are generic priests (of any mythos) who tend to the spiritual needs of a community. While they are both protectors and healers, they are not purely defensive. When evil threatens, clerics are well-suited to seek it out on its own ground and destroy it. The opposite is true of evil clerics as well.~
@9560  = ~DRUID: Druids serve the cause of nature and neutrality; the wilderness is their community. They use their special powers to protect it and to preserve balance in the world.~
@9561  = ~THIEF: To accomplish their goals, for good or ill, thieves are skilled pilferers. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are their hallmarks. Whether they turn their talent against innocent passersby and wealthy merchants or oppressors and monsters is a choice for each thief to make.~
@9562  = ~BARD: Bards are also rogues, but they are very different from thieves. Bards' strength is their pleasant and charming personality. With it and their wits they make their way through the world. Bards are talented musicians and walking storehouses of gossip, tall tales, and lore. They learn a little bit about everything that crosses their path and are a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.~
@9563  = ~MAGE: Wizards strive to be masters of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, they study strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of their time to magical research. Wizards must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. They are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. Mages study all types of magic and learn a wide variety of spells. Their broad range makes them well suited to the demands of adventuring.~
@9564  = ~ABJURER: A mage that specializes in protective magics.

@9574  = ~FIGHTER/MAGE: This character can use the abilities of a fighter and a mage, though spells cannot be cast while wearing armor.

Minimum: <MINIMUM>
Maximum: <MAXIMUM>~
@9588  = ~You have been given <number> proficiencies to start your character with. Choose from the above list any of the highlighted proficiencies. If your character is a fighter, they will be able to choose the same proficiency twice. This will grant them specialization with the weapons listed. Keep in mind that a character can use any weapon available to their race and class whether they have proficiency with it or not. However, if they attack using a weapon that they are not proficient with, they suffer a minus to their attack roll.~
@9589  = ~LARGE SWORD: This weapon class allows the character to use bastard swords, two-handed swords, long swords, and scimitars. The thief is able to take this weapon class, but is only allowed to use long swords and scimitars. The druid is able to select this class, but is limited to scimitars alone.~
@9590  = ~SMALL SWORD: This weapon class allows the character to use daggers and short swords. A mage or druid can select this class, but they are restricted to daggers only.~
@9591  = ~BOW: This weapon class allows the character to use longbows, composite longbows, and shortbows. Only fighters, rangers, and paladins can use the composite longbow. Thieves can choose this category, but are restricted to shortbows only.~
@9592  = ~SPEAR: This weapon class allows the character to use spears and halberds. Druids can choose this class, but are restricted to spears only.~
@9593  = ~BLUNT WEAPONS: This weapon class allows the character to use maces, clubs, war hammers, and staves. Druids and thieves can choose this category, but are limited to clubs and staves only. Mages can choose this category, but are limited to staves alone.~
@9594  = ~SPIKED WEAPONS: This weapon class allows the character to use morning stars and flails.~
@9595  = ~AXE: This weapon class allows the character to use battle axes and throwing axes.~
@9596  = ~MISSILE WEAPONS: This weapon class allows the character to use slings, darts, and crossbows. Mages, druids, and thieves can choose this proficiency but are restricted to slings and darts. Clerics can choose this proficiency but are restricted to slings alone.~
@9597  = ~PICK POCKETS (Thievery): The thief uses this ability when filching small items from other people's pockets, sleeves, girdles, packs, etc. To use this ability you must use the thievery button.~
@9598  = ~OPEN LOCKS (Thievery): The thief uses this ability to pick padlocks, door locks, and combination locks.~
@9599  = ~FIND TRAPS: The thief uses this ability to find and disarm small traps, pit traps, and alarms. This ability does not find large mechanical traps.~
@9600  = ~MOVE SILENTLY: The thief uses this ability to move without making sound.~
@9601  = ~HIDE IN SHADOWS: Using this ability, the thief can disappear into shadows, or any other type of concealment-bushes, curtains, crannies, etc.~
@9602  = ~You are to choose your alignment. Your alignment will determine how your character should interact with their environment. Read over each carefully before choosing. If you stray severely from your alignment during the course of the game, there will be consequences.~
@9603  = ~LAWFUL GOOD: Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society with a well-organized government can work to make life better for the majority of the people. To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed. When people respect the laws and try to help one another, society as a whole prospers. Therefore, lawful good characters strive for those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the most people and cause the least harm. An honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and wise king, or a stern but forthright minister of justice are all examples of lawful good people.~
@9604  = ~LAWFUL NEUTRAL: Order and organization are of paramount importance to characters of this alignment. They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether that government is a tyranny or a benevolent democracy. The benefits of organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by their actions. An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of lawful neutral behavior.~
@9605  = ~LAWFUL EVIL: These characters believe in using society and its laws to benefit themselves. Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant. To this end, lawful evil characters support laws and societies that protect their own concerns. If someone is hurt or suffers because of a law that benefits lawful evil characters, too bad. Lawful evil characters obey laws out of fear of punishment. Because they may be forced to honor an unfavorable contract or oath they have made, lawful evil characters are usually very careful about giving their word. Once given, they break their word only if they can find a way to do it legally, within the laws of the society. An iron-fisted tyrant and a devious, greedy merchant are examples of lawful evil beings.~
@9606  = ~NEUTRAL GOOD: These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the concerns of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good. Since the universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it may even maintain it. If fostering good means supporting organized society, then that is what must be done. If good can only come about through the overthrow of existing social order, so be it. Social structure itself has no innate value to them. A baron who violates the orders of his king to destroy something he sees as evil is an example of a neutral good character.~
@9607  = ~NEUTRAL EVIL: Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and their own advancement. They have no particular objection to working with others or, for that matter, going it on their own. Their only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy way to gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously illegal, they take advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters, they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions for personal gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays people to the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical examples of neutral evil characters.~
@9608  = ~TRUE NEUTRAL: True neutral characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and they refuse to see actions as either good or evil. Since the majority of people in the world make judgments, true neutral characters are extremely rare. True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the forces of either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their duty to see that all of these forces remain in balanced contention. True neutral characters sometimes find themselves forced into rather peculiar alliances. To a great extent, they are compelled to side with the underdog in any given situation, sometimes even changing sides as the previous loser becomes the winner. A true neutral druid might join the local barony to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop out or switch sides when the gnolls are brought to the brink of destruction. He would seek to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Clearly, there are very few true neutral characters in the world.~
@9609  = ~CHAOTIC GOOD: Chaotic good characters are strong individualists marked by a streak of kindness and benevolence. They believe in all the virtues of goodness and right, but they have little use for laws and regulations. They have no use for people who "try to push folk around and tell them what to do." Their actions are guided by their own moral compass which, although good, may not always be in perfect agreement with the rest of society. A brave frontiersman forever moving on as settlers follow in his wake is an example of a chaotic good character.~
@9610  = ~CHAOTIC NEUTRAL: Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.~
@9611  = ~CHAOTIC EVIL: These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized. Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for themselves. The strong have the right to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by a desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies. Such a group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of bullying his underlings into obedience. Since leadership is based on raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low intelligence are fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.~

@9613  = ~He went down the stairs right over there. He was sure in a hurry. If you're going after the guy, it'd probably be good of you to get a little more prepared than you look. Down there's the thief warrens, and they're really dangerous. Go talk to Black Lily over in the store room by the stairs. She'll give you some good prices on equipment. I even hear that she sells some magic stuff.~
@9614  = ~No need to be rude! If yer "important task" is finding that big armored guy, then he went right down the stairs to the east. He and his friend were sure in a hurry. If I were you though, I'd first stock up on equipment. Those are the thief warrens down the stairs, and they ain't no place any sane man would care to go. Go talk to Black Lily in the store room by the stairs. She has lots of items for sale, even magic if you have the money.~
@9615  = ~Don't be so rude. You never know who you are talking to.~
@9616  = ~Is that a threat? Wait a moment... you... you are the people wanted for murder! The ones that killed those Iron Throne merchants in Candlekeep! Sarevok issued a description of you, and all the Flaming Fist are to kill you on sight! Please don't hurt me! I swear I won't tell a soul I saw you!~

@9620  = ~War is imminent? I thought tensions were decreasing.~
@9621  = ~Amn still denies any wrongdoing, even though Sarevok himself has questioned bandits and they apparently admitted they were Amnian agents. Sarevok has sworn that he will stand firm against Amn, even pursuing war if that is what they wish. If he becomes a Grand Duke, he will have all the influence he needs to launch an attack. I think it's about time we took the fight to them, and Sarevok is the man to lead us.~
@9622  = ~Ayup, there be tensions rising 'tween us 'n Amn. There'll be war soon, 'n plague, 'n pestilence. Better them than us, I say.~
@9623  = ~Plague and pestilence? What from?~
@9624  = ~Do you really think there'll be war?~
@9625  = ~From war, of course. What else do ye think would follow in its wake? That's why we need Sarevok as Grand Duke, for he'd take the resources from the Iron Throne an' assist us. Attack first an' fight the war on their soil rather than our own. As I told ye, better them than us.~
@9626  = ~Aye, it's inevitable by now, I figure. That's why we need someone like Sarevok as Grand Duke. He's with the Iron Throne and they've got good iron. Funny how somethin' small like iron can win a war fer ye or at least make it a little shorter an' more livable for us poor folk.~

@9629  = ~You look lost, citizen. Can I be of any assistance?~
@9630  = ~Not so much lost as curious, officer. Have you any news on how close we are to war with Amn?~
@9631  = ~No thank you, sir. I was just admiring the architecture.~
@9632  = ~On the brink, I reckon. Angelo's been mobilizing the Fist for war and equipping us with solid weapons forged from good Iron Throne ore. It's a good thing that Angelo has such close ties to Sarevok or we'd be lost. And a good thing he's been there to take command, too, what with Duke Eltan sick.~
@9633  = ~Why would the Flaming Fist be short on members?~
@9634  = ~Many have been sent out of the city to protect Beregost. I imagine most of the rest will follow, especially once Sarevok declares war on Amn. It will be good to take the fight to their soil for a change. Serves them right for their dishonorable tactics to date. I bet Sarevok doesn't wait long after his coronation to invade. Serves them right!~
@9635  = ~One of the dukes is sick? What with?~
@9636  = ~Hmm, this does not bode well at all.~
@9637  = ~Hello there, stranger. Is there something I can do for you?~
@9638  = ~Oh, I don't know. It can't be serious. His cleric, Rashad, is caring for him. If you wish to visit him, he's in his rooms at the Flaming Fist compound.~
@9639  = ~We're the Flaming Fist, citizen. You need have no fear of those Amnian fools. If you doubt me, visit our barracks in the city. We are well prepared, I promise you.~

My name is Addy and, like you, I am no friend of the Iron Throne nor its leader, Sarevok. He's whipping the people of this city into a frenzy with his wretched war plans! And no one seems to realize that Amn, the most powerful nation—nay, empire—in the hemisphere, would crush us in an instant! I hate myself for it, but... but I am so scared for this city. Please, you must investigate the Iron Throne tower further because I know that, despite all your past efforts there, some horror still rests within its walls.~
@9646  = ~Sarevok is whipping the people of this city into a frenzy with his wretched war plans!

Please, you must investigate the Iron Throne tower further because I know that, despite all your past efforts there, some horror still rests within its walls.~
@9647  = ~It is good to know that not everyone in this city has fallen in love with the hardliner, Sarevok. Frightened by the prospect of the looming war, a noblewoman by the name of Addy has begged me to re-investigate the Iron Throne tower in the hopes that I might find something there to stem this maddened tide.~
@9648  = ~I have learned that Duke Eltan, Commander of the Flaming Fist, lies sick in bed at the Fist Compound, tended to by his cleric Rashad. A man named Angelo seems to be acting in his stead and, from all accounts, seems to be closely connected to Sarevok and the Flaming Fist. I find myself overwhelmed with a sense of unease about this all. Sick or not, perhaps Duke Eltan has some answers for me.~
@9649  = ~The Flaming Fist are gearing up for war and arming themselves with weapons forged from Iron Throne ore. A man named Angelo, with apparent ties to Sarevok, seems to be leading them. All of this leads me to the conclusion that it might be high time I paid a visit to the Flaming Fist barracks in the city.~
@9650  = ~The streets seem subdued. Why is everyone so depressed?~

@9656  = ~You should pay more attention to current events or at least the talk in the taverns. Duke Eltan, the leader of the Flaming Fist, is gravely ill; Scar, the second-in-command, is dead; and Grand Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated. It does not take a genius to see that we are under siege. The question to ask is who could be behind it? Everyone says Amn, but I'm not sure.~
@9657  = ~Hey, <CHARNAME>, lonely night, ain't it?~
@9658  = ~Do I know you?~
@9659  = ~Aye, lonely enough.~
@9660  = ~Well, I know you, I do. You worked for Scar... Aye, he's dead, he is.~
@9661  = ~Scar's dead? You must tell me how!~
@9662  = ~I never saw it meself, but there's a man in the Blushin' Mermaid who saw it all and charges 10 gp for the tale, he does. His name's Ivanne and if you're so curious about it, <CHARNAME>, I recommend ye check him out, I do, and leave me to my business.~
@9663  = ~And lonelier now, I bet, without Scar to lead ye about the place. He's dead, he is, and there's talk 'twas murder. Ivanne in the Blushin' Mermaid saw it all, he did.~
@9664  = ~Move on, chumps. Ye're scarin' away the paying customers, ye are.~
@9665  = ~Sugar, one of the ladies of the night about these parts, tells me that Scar is dead. He was a good man and I almost curse myself for having left his side but I suppose I had other tasks more pressing. Sugar directed me to a certain Ivanne in the Blushing Mermaid, who claims to have been witness to the dirty deed. Perhaps I should pay him a visit.~
@9666  = ~Sugar~
@9667  = ~Sugar~
@9668  = ~Aye, would ye like to pay a penny for tale of murder an' deceit? 10 gold it be, an' worth each one.~
@9669  = ~Still not interested.~
@9670  = ~A dark price for a dark tale but I'll pay and hear it told.~
@9671  = ~Before I lay my money down, tell me the victim's name and whe'er it be fact or fiction.~
@9672  = ~Heh, Scar it was, second-in-command of that noble Flaming Fist, and on a night-dark street it happened. The rain, 'twas spattering against the window's glassy panes and soaking up through me bootwraps, givin' me the chill. A cunning cut-throat rushed on by 'im an' cut the straps o' his travel purse wit' a blood-sharp knife before turnin' down the alleyway. Aye, good man Scar, he chased the culprit there into the dark as I came stumblin' through the puddles to 'is aid.~
@9673  = ~Well! Such manners I would expect on the docks, but never in this part of town. Leave me.~
@9674  = ~Just get out of my way. I've no interest in you.~
@9675  = ~Where are you going this fine day?~
@9676  = ~I am going home, if it is any of your concern. The streets are unsafe in the later hours, though I am sure that it will change soon. Now that Angelo Dosan heads the Flaming Fist, they will be cracking down on everything that was wrong before. He has the full backing of that Sarevok fellow, don't you know?~
@9677  = ~But that petty cut-purse, 'e weren't the rugged waif that he appeared to be—Nay, he was a silver-skinned changeling, 'e were, an' wit' his dagger-claws 'e gored the good man through the eyes. Then 'e slit 'is neck so vicious just to leave 'im bleedin' in the rain. My proffer'd aid, ye ask? Aye, 'twas as quickly withdrawn as rashly granted and I hid there in the shadows as the mirror-fiend assumed new form to saunter, bloody-handed into the darkening night. My aid comes in that I'm here to tell the truth of the good man's passin' to any list'ner that can spare the coin. 'Tis enough, I figure, an' I doubt 'e'd disagree.~
@9678  = ~Fair 'nuf, that is. The victim's name be Good Man Scar of the Flaming Fist an' me tale be true as rain and strange as ice. Are ye willin' now to lay yer 10 gold down?~
@9679  = ~If Scar lies dead, it is best I hear the tale. Here's the money, friend, and I pray you tell it true.~
@9680  = ~Another time, my friend. Another time.~
@9681  = ~Aye, the tale is always here an' will not change wit' tellin'. Come again when ye be ready for the truth.~
@9682  = ~In his corner of the Blushing Mermaid Tavern, Ivanne charges 10 gp for the chance to hear his morbid tale. Scar has been murdered in my absence, it seems, and should I ever wish to hear the details of his death, they like as not shall come from Ivanne's mouth. It would be good to return here when I have more time to listen.~
@9683  = ~I have listened to the tale of Ivanne, sole witness to Scar's death, save his killer. Judging by Ivanne's telling, Scar was lured to his horrific death by yet another doppelganger, no doubt in the hire of the Iron Throne, though Ivanne thought Angelo might have good cause. Scar's passing was mercifully brief, at least, though more for reasons of stealth than of compassion. Aye, I have seen so many of these foul mirrorkin of late but I pray I never become accustomed to their cursed, shifting faces. If I should get to the bottom of this murder, there are only two places I can think of searching: the tower of the Iron Throne or the barracks of the Flaming Fist, where Duke Eltan is said to lie in sickly pallor. All else, it seems, is meaningless.~
@9684  = ~Ivanne~
@9685  = ~Ivanne~
@9686  = ~The mirror-fiend you speak of is known as a doppelganger. I have encountered more than one of late, all in the hire of the Iron Throne. Do you know of any reason why the Throne would want Scar dead?~
@9687  = ~The Iron Throne, is it? Well, this lies outside me simple tellin', but it may enrich it yet. Duke Eltan lies sick within the compound of the Flaming Fist, so good man Scar 'ad filled the former's office as their leader. Angelo, a link below the good man in the chain, 'ad the most to gain by the killin', an' it's he who I'd suspected. But the Iron Throne, I couldn't say. If ye thinks there be some truth to it, ye should investigate either the compound of the Fist or the tower of the Throne, for therein would lie yer answers...~
@9688  = ~Make way; I bear a message for the dukes from the Great Empire of Amn!~
@9689  = ~~
@9690  = ~I doubt the dukes care about the pompous words of your precious Amn, little one.~
@9691  = ~What message? Is there war?~
@9692  = ~Hah, they'll care when we turn the ballistas on Beregost, fool. We've had enough of the dukes' quaint belligerence and are well prepared to colonize this port as we have colonized fair Maztica across the sea... little one...~
@9693  = ~Patience wears thin in Athkatla. We're massing troops along our northern border and are prepared to advance on Baldur's Gate in short order should they continue any longer with their belligerence... Tell all who care, for if Amn goes to war, it shall be total war: against this city's citizens as much as against its bragging Dukes.~
@9694  = ~I have intercepted an Amnian messenger bearing tides of impending war. They are massing troops along their borders and have the arrogance of war about them. We are being manipulated to the edge of a great chasm, it appears, and I must right it before we tumble into the gaping, hellish depths before us!~
@9695  = ~<CHARNAME>, where have you been?~
@9696  = ~Well, keep your head down before they clip it from your shoulders, fool. People are saying you killed the leaders of the Iron Throne. There's a goodly price upon your head, don't you realize?~
@9697  = ~I had some business to attend to back at home but I fear that same business has drawn me back to the Gate.~
@9698  = ~What do you want?~
@9699  = ~A price on my head? And you'll not take it?~
@9700  = ~I can take care of myself. Go back the way you came and stop drawing attention to me.~
@9701  = ~There's trouble in the Fist, <CHARNAME>, big trouble. Duke Eltan's fallen sick and Scar was killed, supposedly in a simple robbery but I have my doubts... It's all Angelo, he's making a power grab, taking control of the Fist and, with Scar out of the way, there's nothing to stop him! I've seen him paying visits to the Iron Throne, too, and I don't like it one bit... There are some of us that are still loyal to Eltan and, lucky for you, I happen to be one of them. Please, for your sake and ours, keep your head down and, if you get the chance, sniff around the Iron Throne's base. If you can find a way to talk to Duke Eltan, even better, but they're keeping him in the middle of Fist headquarters... Damn it, Angelo will pay dearly for this and I hope it's soon...~
@9702  = ~Aye, I never liked you, but I'll do as you ask. There are greater things at stake right now. While you're skulking about, though, take the time to look a little closer at what's going on in the Iron Throne base and the Fist headquarters. Much depends on it.~
@9703  = ~Angelo is making a power grab within the Flaming Fist and may be responsible both for Duke Eltan's sickness and Scar's death. His reputed connections to the Iron Throne leave me more than suspicious. It's a question of where to turn: shall I go back to the Iron Throne and continue my investigations there or should I seek out Duke Eltan at the Flaming Fist compound and test my suspicions regarding his disease?~
@9704  = ~Sorrel of the Flaming Fist has urged me to investigate the Iron Throne base once more and the Fist headquarters. I fear I was a bit brusque with him, however, and he left without giving me the reasons for such a request.~
@9705  = ~Word of my recent misadventures in Candlekeep appear to have reached Baldur's Gate. The Flaming Fist has placed a value on my head and I am sure more than one private mercenary has also taken interest. It would be wise to proceed with caution, I am sure.~
@9706  = ~Sorrel~
@9707  = ~Sorrel~
@9708  = ~<CHARNAME>, you cut yourself above the brow, there— What is wrong, child? Something in your eyes tells me that something is very wrong indeed.~
@9709  = ~Oh, Parda! There was a man in there, he smelled like the stables, and he— and he tried to kill me, it was horrible...~
@9710  = ~It's— It's nothing Parda. One of the cats didn't like me petting it. I'm all right, really...~
@9711  = ~Hurry then, child. Equip yourself at the Inn and go join Gorion on the steps of the library... I had a sense something like this might happen.~
@9712  = ~Mm, yes, well... Get what you need from the Inn then, for Gorion is desperate for you to be off.~
@9713  = ~Seek my comfort, will you? Aye, I'll show you a sweet and silent comfort if ye'll let me, wasteling.~
@9714  = ~I heard shouting, <CHARNAME>! Are you all right?~
@9715  = ~He's... He's dead, whoever he was. He lunged at me with a knife. Oh, Karan, what is happening to this place?~
@9716  = ~It is better you don't ask questions, Karan. You have instructed and inspired me throughout my childhood and your heart would break to see what has just transpired here.~
@9717  = ~It's not this place, child. It's you they're after. Gorion is waiting on the steps to the central library and wants you to go to him as soon as you have bought what you need at the Inn. Oh, <CHARNAME>, I have been your tutor for so many years and only in this moment have I come to doubt that my teachings have been enough. Go to Gorion, child. It is safe for you here no longer.~
@9718  = ~Oh, child! You are too young for the life that is being thrust upon you... If you be fully equipped for your journey, I pray you run now to Gorion on the library steps for he is anxious to depart.~
@9719  = ~Dullard! Insolent waif! I tried to instruct you, tried to make you wise, but it was like drawing compassion from a Zhent! You are a nothing, child, and you will soon become much less! Thssss!~
@9720  = ~Here there, you look a bit hard pressed for a place to rest. Care to chat a spell before slinking off into the night? I think I saw you about the Thieves' Guild before. I canna remember your name, but any friend is a good friend if you're running out of them. Eh? What say you?~
@9721  = ~Thanks, but why would you be running out of friends?~
@9722  = ~I don't know you. Sod off!~
@9723  = ~The Thieves' Guild! I would never associate myself with them!~
@9724  = ~Ah, Baldur's Gate is nearly a jail itself in these times, but that doesn't stop the guard from locking you away for the slightest reason. The entire city is on edge, and every member of the Flaming Fist is out for blood. Can't say that I blame them. I would be right upset if I was in their shoes. Scar, their second-in-command, was killed recently. Don't really know the circumstances; some say it was accident, some say murder... But it has only served to increase tensions. Especially since Duke Entar Silvershield was assassinated. No guesswork as to what happened there.~
@9725  = ~Who could have done such a thing?~
@9726  = ~What will the Flaming Fist do without effective leadership?~
@9727  = ~Oh, any number of people, really. The question is, who would have the motive? Fingers are pointing all over. Odds-on favorite is the same person who killed those merchants in Candlekeep, though no one seems to have a concrete reason. I would wager that the other Dukes are in some measure of peril as well, though Duke Eltan is close to death already. Some sort of wasting disease, though it defies curing. Hard to imagine an honest sickness that cannot be cured in this day and age.~
@9728  = ~It would seem I have made an error. You are no more a friend of mine than the guards themselves. If we meet again I shall not be so trusting, or so lightly armed.~
@9729  = ~You needn't keep up the pretense with me. I'm in no position to be blowing the whistle on any of my fellow sneaksmen. Fine, if you don't want your nature known, so be it. I can't really blame you, what with the Flaming Fist rounding up roustabouts like there was no tomorrow. I know their leader is ill and their second-in-command is dead, but is that any excuse for rough treatment? Perhaps it is, especially since Duke Entar Silvershield was killed.~
@9730  = ~You are your father's child, <CHARNAME>. I have come to put an end to it.~
@9731  = ~You knew my father?~
@9732  = ~Who has sent you? The Iron Throne?~
@9733  = ~Don't be a fool. No one knew your father. It's a pity that you followed in his evil ways, child. Your stepfather, Gorion, he had such faith in you but you have cheapened his death with your choices in this life. This shall not continue further.~
@9734  = ~Who could have done such a thing?~
@9735  = ~A Harper in the employ of the Iron Throne? I doubt it highly, child. Come now, dark one, and let our duel begin...~
@9736  = ~What will the Flaming Fist do without effective leadership?~
@9737  = ~They still have leadership. How effective it is, I do not know. I hear Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control. Such a weasel he is. I am surprised he has the support of the troops. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. You've heard of him, right? With Entar dead, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the frontrunner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Imagine how much pull he will have if he actually has the Flaming Fist in his back pocket.~
@9738  = ~I have been beset by the weak and petty forces of good. My true father, it seems, followed the dark path as I do. Ha, then, I am strengthened by the knowledge that I am my father's child.~
@9739  = ~Beset by a Harper today. Made short work of him.~
@9740  = ~Khalid, old friend! You have cared well for your ward but where is Jahei— Oh Khalid, I am sorry... I trust she died as she lived: in beauty and in defiance... <CHARNAME>, I am Entillis Fulsom of the Harpers, a friend of your friends and of your stepfather, Gorion.~
@9741  = ~I am honored, Harper. You seem to be more knowledgeable of my situation than myself. Have you any advice regarding my coming tasks?~
@9742  = ~A friend of good Khalid is ever a friend of mine. We are well met, Entillis.~
@9743  = ~Nay, the honor is mine, <CHARNAME>. You are a very special individual and, sadly, this has placed you in grave danger. I yearn to tell you more but I'm afraid I cannot for fear of endangering you further. Here in the city, if you wish to succeed against the Iron Throne, know that you can trust Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist. They are good men and friends of ours. But I tarry too long when there are urgent matters to attend to elsewhere. We are well met, <CHARNAME>. Take care of Khalid, he has suffered much.~
@9744  = ~Spell Failed: Indoors~
@9745  = ~Duke Eltan would never stand by and let someone take control of the Flaming Fist.~
@9746  = ~Animate Dead (Necromancy)
Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or zombies can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat, 8 hours pass, or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The priest can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained.~
@9747  = ~Teleport us to the secret library; we're as ready as we'll ever be.~
@9748  = ~Why can't you teleport us outside of Candlekeep?~
@9749  = ~Candlekeep is protected by powerful runes that seal it from divinatory and alteration magics. If I were to teleport you outside of Candlekeep, you would be ripped asunder when you came in contact with the protective field. Trust me, child, this is the only way.~
@9750  = ~Someone has gone to a lot of trouble to ensure that Ulraunt thinks we murdered the leaders of the Iron Throne. Who would want the Iron Throne leaders dead... other than us, that is?~
@9751  = ~Duke Eltan is in no position to prevent it. As I understand it, he is barely clinging to life. No one seems to be able to help him, even though he is attended around the clock by a healer named Rashad. You didn't hear this from me, but I've a few friends that know of this Rashad. Let's just say that I do not put much faith in Duke Eltan surviving the week.~
@9752  = ~You have information such as this, and you tell no one?~
@9753  = ~As if anyone would believe an old sneak-thief like me. What are my words without proof? If somebody truly wanted to look into this matter, they would have to investigate at the Flaming Fist headquarters itself. I ain't setting foot in such a place. If you've the will, you go do it.~
@9754  = ~Are you saying that it is not a natural disease?~
@9755  = ~I would say nothing of the sort where another ear could hear it. If Dukes are to be killed with impunity, what chance would I stand? It is simply a curious development that Eltan would fall ill at such a time and that Angelo Dosan would step into his place with such vigor. He does not seem the ambitious sort, that Angelo, though Sarevok may have instilled a more predatory instinct in him. Sarevok has that effect, I hear, and he is supposedly working quite close with this acting head of the Flaming Fist, Angelo.~
@9756  = ~You have information such as this, and you tell no one?~
@9757  = ~Such insolence! His popularity may be soaring, but I'll not cast a vote for a lout such as he! The nerve of the man!~
@9758  = ~What is your trouble, m'lady?~
@9759  = ~Off with you. I do not care for your upper-class whining.~
@9760  = ~Pardon, but I do not have time to speak with you.~
@9761  = ~Then go. I've things far more important than you to deal with.~
@9762  = ~If it is any of your concern, I am simply furious at that Sarevok man! I did not raise a fortune in this city by letting such as he stroll off with my assets! I have had dealings with the Iron Throne mercantile group for some time now, and though I did not approve of some of their... other ventures, they were at least honorable business people in their contracts with me. Now that Sarevok leads them, he has all but declared my previous deals null and void!~
@9763  = ~You will get no sympathy from me if you lost gold dealing with a group like the Iron Throne!~
@9764  = ~If I were not already incensed at Sarevok, I would stop to tear a strip off of you too. As it is, I must speak with the Grand Dukes about Sarevok's conduct! Imagine! He secures himself as leader of the Iron Throne and then all but destroys its mercantile credibility by practically sacking it! He may be bolstering the city with its assets, but it is still unprofessional! Something strange is going on at that Iron Throne building, I tell you! I know their previous leadership was killed, but those members remaining would still never let such treatment come to pass. Not willingly, anyway.~
@9765  = ~Hello hello. I don't suppose you would be interested in a few trinkets? A coin or two for my finely crafted wares? Ehh, I thought not. The iron shortage wanes, but even so, the customers do not come back quite yet. Who can blame them though? They are afraid because they see that the merchants are still without wares. Who believes that a shortage has ended, when they still cannot hold a new blade in their hands? I blame the Iron Throne, I do. Many others do as well.~
@9766  = ~Why do you blame them? What have they done?~
@9767  = ~Have ye heard? There was an attempt on the Grand Dukes' lives during Sarevok's coronation. Seems that Sarevok wasn't lookin' out for the city's best interests after all. From what I've heard, it was him behind all the murders and such that have been plaguing our city.~
@9768  = ~I am not surprised. Their role in the iron shortage was pure villainy.~
@9769  = ~Excuse me? Where have you heard such tales? As far as any are concerned in this city, the Iron Throne is a respectable mercantile group. Such talk as yours without proof will get you nowhere, I am sure.~
@9770  = ~<CHARNAME>'s band of adventurers have saved the city! Seems that Sarevok was trying to kill all of the Grand Dukes so that he could take power. Without <CHARNAME>, all of us common folk would be in a heap of trouble.~
@9771  = ~Ain't you <CHARNAME>?! Ya, ya you are! You saved the city, saved it from Sarevok you did. I just want ta shake yer hand. Weren't fer you, we'd probably be in a war with Amn right now, and that's not a war I think we could win.~
@9772  = ~Sarevok's been playing us for fools the entire time! The town criers have been screaming it across the city. The crummy loggerhead murdered his own dad to become leader of the Iron Throne, and almost murdered the other Grand Dukes. I don't know what crazy plans he had, but it's good that he didn't succeed.~
@9773  = ~I can't believe it! Sarevok was trying to destroy our city. He was such a handsome one, such a shame that he had ta go and do that.~
@9774  = ~That crummy Sarevok was an evil one, yes he was! He murdered Scar, and Entar and tried to kill lots of others! He deserves death, and I hope it's swiftly coming to him.~
@9775  = ~Then what did you mean?~
@9776  = ~I was talking about the Iron Throne's actions since Sarevok has assumed control of it. He is disinterested, and seems likely to sacrifice it to fund the re-arming of Baldur's Gate, and thus his bid to become a Grand Duke. It is the Iron Throne's instability which has prolonged the strife in the city, and that is why other merchants blame them. They were major importers, and without their help it will take much longer to reassure people that all is well. It makes no business sense that they should do this, and I think there is something very wrong at their headquarters.~
@9777  = ~Why if it weren't fer <CHARNAME>, Sarevok would have taken over the entire city. It's good that we have heroes like that to stand up to the likes of Sarevok.~
@9778  = ~It's so frightening! To think that Sarevok came so close to completing his murderous plans. I hope someone tracks him down so he can be brought to justice. He's gotta be made an example, so that other crazies don't try to do what he did.~
@9779  = ~Nothing direct, I suppose, though the impact is still harsh. Since Sarevok assumed control, they have ceased most business transactions and frozen most of their assets. They were major importers, and without their active help, it will be much longer before the average citizen feels that the crisis is over. It would seem that Sarevok is going to use the Iron Throne to fuel his harsh stance on Amn and thus his bid for the position of Grand Duke. The fact that he is crippling a large merchant house seems inconsequential to him. I cannot imagine sane businessmen following such directives. Something is very odd at the Iron Throne building indeed.~
@9780  = ~I canna believe I threw my vote in with such scum! To think that Sarevok hoodwinked us all so well. Well, in the future I'll have to learn to use better judgment.~
@9781  = ~What Sarevok did was unforgivable! Duke Eltan should organize the Flaming Fist and go after the scum, before he can do any more hurt.~
@9782  = ~<CHARNAME>, wait up a moment. I have to congratulate you on a job well done. The city needs more people like you! Why, without you, I can just imagine what Sarevok would have done. He had us all eating out of his palm, I'm just glad you were there to expose him as the fraud that he was.~
@9783  = ~It is a sad day here in the Gate. I am sure that none have gone through this tenday unchanged. It would seem the streets are no longer safe, even within our great walls.~
@9784  = ~What has happened to make you feel this way?~
@9785  = ~Certainly it cannot be as bad as you say?~
@9786  = ~Aww, cheer up. A smile makes any day brighter.~
@9787  = ~What has happened? You must have been under a rock for some time, stranger. Entar Silvershield has passed, murdered it is said! If a Grand Duke is not safe, how are the rest of us to function? What has happened indeed.~
@9788  = ~Not as bad as I say? When a Grand Duke can be struck down and the city guards can do nothing? It would seem to be even worse.~
@9789  = ~Such unbridled optimism will likely get you slapped during this dark time. Entar Silvershield is dead, and when a Grand Duke can be assassinated what does that say about the state of affairs?~
@9790  = ~What is happening in our fair city? Some Amnian plot I'll wager! We weathered their little iron plot, so they resort to assassinating our leaders! Duke Entar Silvershield is dead, Duke Eltan is gravely ill!~
@9791  = ~Do you think the two events are related?~
@9792  = ~Do they have suspects in the assassination?~
@9793  = ~Why are you so worried? It's not as if assassins are roaming the streets.~
@9794  = ~More than likely. Eltan slips closer to death's door and our government is in shambles. It's a good thing that Sarevok fellow is stepping in. He seems a man to get things done. I'd follow him into battle if it came to war with Amn. Did you know they still have the nerve to deny they are behind it all? The curs!~
@9795  = ~They don't even have the first clue where to look for a suspect. That's why I'm glad that Sarevok fellow is stepping in. Him and the new leader of the Flaming Fist will get things done. They seem to work well together.~
@9796  = ~You... you look familiar. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were that group of hooligans that killed those fellows in Candlekeep! The Flaming Fist issued a description and sketches, and you're the spitting image! Get away from me!~
@9797  = ~Not polite to go about the city armed as you are. Can't say that I blame you though. Flaming Fist is in a mess right now and it's up to the citizens to take care of themselves in a lot of places.~
@9798  = ~Why is the Flaming Fist in such disorder?~
@9799  = ~What places do you mean? Where should I be careful?~
@9800  = ~You don't know? Scar, second-in-command of the Fist, was killed—I think murdered—not long ago, and Duke Eltan is still too sick to lead them. Angelo Dosan has stepped up to take the role, but he seems to be in the back pocket of that Sarevok person. Not that this is necessarily bad. Sarevok seems like a man who gets things done.~
@9801  = ~The whole city is on edge, so I would be careful everywhere. Things are really strange by the Iron Throne building though. I heard their leaders were killed or something. Sarevok has announced that he is assuming control of them though, and he's going to use their resources to help reinforce the city against Amn. He's making a lot of friends, and I bet he will be nominated to replace poor Entar as Grand Duke.~
@9802  = ~If you don't mind, I'm not in the mood for speaking right now.~
@9803  = ~What is wrong? The iron crisis is easing up and trade routes are opening again.~
@9804  = ~Don't be so rude. You never know who you are talking to.~
@9805  = ~True, but whoever was behind the troubles before have now switched tactics. Since the iron crisis didn't weaken us significantly, they have turned to killing our leaders. Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated, and with Duke Eltan practically on his deathbed something must be done. An election of sorts has been called because we cannot be without a full government in these dangerous times. I hear Sarevok is a frontrunner in this matter.~
@9806  = ~Is that a threat? Wait a moment... you... you are the people wanted for murder! The ones that killed those Iron Throne merchants in Candlekeep! Sarevok issued a description of you, and all the Flaming Fist are to kill you on sight! Please don't hurt me! I swear I won't tell a soul I saw you!~
@9807  = ~Poor Eltan. Know what I heard? My sister is a friend of the duke's maid, and she said that he is on death's door! He's got a healer with him always, but he doesn't seem to be getting any better. Rashad is the healer's name, and even though he seems well intentioned, she also says that he's... well... just kind of weird.~
@9808  = ~I hope they have enough troops amidst the Flaming Fist. It's going to be a long war if Amn continues its attacks.~
@9809  = ~War is imminent? I thought tensions were decreasing.~
@9810  = ~Why would the Flaming Fist be short on members?~
@9811  = ~Amn still denies any wrongdoing, even though Sarevok himself has questioned bandits and they apparently admitted they were Amnian agents. Sarevok has sworn that he will stand firm against Amn, even pursuing war if that is what they wish. If he becomes a Grand Duke, he will have all the influence he needs to launch an attack. I think it's about time we took the fight to them, and Sarevok is the man to lead us.~
@9812  = ~Many have been sent out of the city to protect Beregost. I imagine most of the rest will follow, especially once Sarevok declares war on Amn. It will be good to take the fight to their soil for a change. Serves them right for their dishonorable tactics to date. I bet Sarevok doesn't wait long after his coronation to invade. Serves them right!~
@9813  = ~Hello there, stranger? Is there something I can do for you?~
@9814  = ~The streets seem subdued. Why is everyone so depressed?~
@9815  = ~Just get out of my way. I've no interest in you.~
@9816  = ~Where are you going this fine day?~
@9817  = ~You should pay more attention to current events or at least the talk in the taverns. Duke Eltan, the leader of the Flaming Fist, is gravely ill; Scar, the second-in-command, is dead; and Grand Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated. It does not take a genius to see that we are under siege. The question to ask is who could be behind it? Everyone says Amn, but I'm not sure.~
@9818  = ~Well! Such manners I would expect on the docks, but never in this part of town. Leave me.~
@9819  = ~I am going home, if it is any of your concern. The streets are unsafe in the later hours, though I am sure that it will change soon. Now that Angelo Dosan heads the Flaming Fist, they will be cracking down on everything that was wrong before. He has the full backing of that Sarevok fellow, don't you know?~
@9820  = ~My word, I am surprised that louts like you are on the streets. Adventurers are surely the first to be shanghaied when war comes. Best that you keep your wits about you and watch your backs, eh wot?~
@9821  = ~War? What war?~
@9822  = ~Hey, kid, the world is full of disillusionment. Live with it.~
@9823  = ~You're right, don't worry, we'll stop her.~
@9824  = ~I doubt someone would risk trying that with me.~
@9825  = ~Oh, that's rich. What war? Haw indeed. Why my little uninformed friend, the coming war with Amn of course. It is all but certain, especially when Sarevok takes the helm. They will learn not to mess with us, by gum!~
@9826  = ~Famous last words about which countless amusing tales will no doubt be told. No, my friend, you underestimate what people will stoop to in times of strife. Tensions build, tempers flare, and all of a sudden you find yourself trussed up in a cart heading for the front lines. Such things can happen in troubled times, and times have rarely been as troubled as they are now.~
@9827  = ~I can finally hold my head high again as a citizen of Baldur's Gate. Sarevok is petitioning to be the newest Grand Duke, and who could possibly refuse him? He brings the resources of the fallen Iron Throne, and will prepare us all should Amn dare to test our borders. Strong leadership for trying times.~
@9828  = ~It's not safe for a true lady to walk the streets or travel the coast, but this is going to change soon. Entar Silvershield's death was a tragic blow, but with Sarevok stepping in I feel a true sense of hope. He seems so sure of what we need. It has been a long time since we have been sure of what we needed.~
@9829  = ~Stand away from me, if you please. I trust no one with common murderers on the loose. Those poor men in Candlekeep cut down, and the people who did it could be anywhere. They could be here in the city and I would not even know it.~
@9830  = ~It is a good time to be of the nobility. Sarevok has ensured us all that order will be restored in this region, whatever the cost. It is about time someone got tough with those Amnian hooligans. They must be animals, because there is no logical reason for their continued attacks and denials.~
@9831  = ~If you don't mind, I've an important luncheon I must get to and I do not intend to tell my guests that I was late because some roustabouts were pestering me for attention. What is it you want?~
@9832  = ~Mind me personal space! I don't need no strangers getting in me way. Sorry, but I's just a bit edgy these days. Can't blame me though. I don't know what them nobles see in that Sarevok fella, but he's something darker, that's for certain. I know people that used to be with the Iron Throne, and he... did something to them. Something strange. May the gods help us all if he becomes Duke.~
@9833  = ~I don't know who you are, but I don't need you poking about my face!~
@9834  = ~I'm just a stranger that needs some directions. Relax.~
@9835  = ~Save your attitude! All I want is some info about the Iron Throne.~
@9836  = ~All right, all right, I'm leaving.~
@9837  = ~The Iron Throne? Why would you want to know about them fellows? Buncha stiffs, they are. Used to be all stuck up and serious, but at least you could talk to them. Now you couldn't get a reaction out of them if you kicked them in the arse. Something weird in their building, I think. You go funny without enough windows.~
@9838  = ~I ain't got no directions for you, except to get out of my way. I ain't staying another moment in this town now that the roads are clearing up. I knew that Scar guy that ran the Flaming Fist for Eltan, and now he's dead. His replacement Angelo is a puppet for Sarevok, and Sarevok is just plain nasty. Nobles like him, but I don't care how much Amn deserves it, I ain't going to war.~
@9839  = ~Good. Don't need you slowing me down.~
@9840  = ~It's so sad, ain't it? Duke Entar Silvershield... dead. I swear he was the most levelheaded of the bunch, and now he's gone. With Duke Eltan sick they'll likely move that Sarevok in, mostly because he's got the backing of the Iron Throne. We're in for it then, I think. That Sarevok is intent on "punishing" Amn, but I swears it just don't make sense.~
@9841  = ~You'd think that with the iron shortage easing up we'd be a little more forgiving, but everyone is still looking for someone to blame. With the most levelheaded of our Dukes dead or dying, that Sarevok is moving in by promising to take the fight to Amn. I still don't know why we hate them so.~
@9842  = ~What do you want?~
@9843  = ~Nothing, m'lady. I was merely wondering if everything was all right here in the city.~
@9844  = ~Nothing at all. I was just leaving.~
@9845  = ~Don't get your knickers in a knot; I don't want to hurt you.~
@9846  = ~Save your fancy talk for the prim little ladies at county fairs; I ain't got a use for it! Is everything all right, you ask? You've got some nerve, you do. I had a brother in that Iron Throne building, I did. He said they were nothing but merchants, but now he acts all strange. Ever since that Sarevok took over, and I don't think that bodes well for the rest of us if he is made Duke. So don't ask me if everything is all right.~
@9847  = ~And a good thing too. I might have to do something right unladylike if you keep in my way.~
@9848  = ~I didn't think you could, you whelp. Bah, unless you are one of them Iron Throne scum I don't even have the time to put you down. My brother worked with them, and now he's... different. I'll put the boots to them, I swear. Something weird is going on in that dark old building of theirs. I just know it.~
@9849  = ~I don't want you bothering me. Who knows who you could be? There's murderers around somewhere, and I hear they's crazy. Killed those poor men in Candlekeep, they did. That Sarevok is going to make everything all right again. He's got the Flaming Fist in his back pocket he does.~
@9850  = ~I don't know which was worse, the supposed threat of bandits and iron shortages, or the real threat of war with Amn.~
@9851  = ~There's going to be a lot of rebuilding to do. The Grand Dukes are going to have a tough time fixing all the damage that Sarevok did. I just hope that trade with Amn doesn't permanently suffer.~
@9852  = ~Well, I never! Can you believe the nerve of that Sarevok fellow? After the trust we all placed in him, he turns out to be nothing but the basest of villains. I hope he's caught and punished.~
@9853  = ~Why, I heard it was all a mix up. <CHARNAME> was not actually responsible for killing the Iron Throne merchants, rather it was that new political figure, Sarevok. Actually, I heard that <CHARNAME> saved the remaining Grand Dukes. If it weren't for them, Sarevok would have murdered the other dukes and taken the city by force!~
@9854  = ~Aren't you <CHARNAME>? You and your companions certainly match the description. Well, on behalf of everyone I know, I'd like to thank you for what you've done. If it weren't for your heroics... Well, I shudder to think how a war with Amn would have turned out. Hopefully someone can catch that villainous Sarevok and put an end to his troublemaking.~
@9855  = ~It's spreading like wildfire! Everyone's talking about what happened at the palace. From what I've heard, that Sarevok fellow isn't as noble as he'd like us all to believe. He tried to have the other Dukes killed, so that he could take over the city.~

@9865  = ~Good day to thee, young one. What a marvelous happenstance that we should again cross paths, especially in such a grand city as this. Ahh, I see by thine eyes that thou've no time for my wry banter. 'Tis true, our meeting was no accident, though I do honestly take pleasure in seeing thee again.~
@9866  = ~I am honored, Harper. You seem to be more knowledgeable of my situation than myself. Have you any advice regarding my coming tasks?~
@9867  = ~A friend of fair Jaheira is ever a friend of mine. We are well met, Entillis.~
@9868  = ~Nay, the honor is mine, <CHARNAME>. You are a very special individual and, sadly, this has placed you in grave danger... I yearn to tell you more but I'm afraid I cannot for fear of endangering you further. Here in the city, if you wish to succeed against the Iron Throne, know that you can trust Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist. They are good men and friends of ours. But I tarry too long when there are urgent matters to attend to elsewhere. We are well met, <CHARNAME>. Take care of Jaheira, for I bounced her on this very knee when she was yet a babe.~
@9869  = ~And a grace befitting your special heritage! Jaheira has cared for you so well and kept you from the dark that was your father. Aye, and it is that dark that would have you dead, child. This city is a dangerous place for you but I understand why you have come. Trust Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist. They are friends of ours and will assist you in your investigations of the Iron Throne however they are able. But I tarry too long here when grave business awaits me elsewhere. Care for Jaheira, <CHARNAME>, as there is no one more dear to this old man's heart.~
@9870  = ~It appears my dear friends Khalid and Jaheira are with the Harpers. I am honored and more than a little frightened to find that I warrant such attention. One of their compatriots, a kindly old gent named Entillis Fulsom, seems well-acquainted with my ongoing investigations into the Iron Throne. He has recommended to me the assistance of Scar and Duke Eltan, two men associated with the honorable Flaming Fist Mercenaries here in Baldur's Gate... Harpers, yet... *sigh* Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things?~
@9871  = ~A pleasure I do not share. Leave me be, old man!~
@9872  = ~I am not some old letch that follows thee around for the good of mine eyes, upstart. If I am to be accused of anything, perhaps it is that I have been a touch too mothering.

@9876  = ~Thou art determined to be confrontational, aren't thee? So be it. I will leave thee to whatever fate that thou dost carve for thyself. I will extend the courtesy of a warning though; thy manner may come natural to thee, but obeying thine impulses is not always the best course. Being true to thyself is only wise if that is truly the self thou dost wish to become. I lecture too long and thine interest fades. Off with thee, to whatever fate will have thee.~
@9877  = ~I don't have any more stories for you at this moment. Perhaps if you come back later, I'll have more tales to tell.~
@9878  = ~It is good to see you again. What brings you here?~
@9879  = ~Oh, all citizens of the Sword Coast eventually pass through Baldur's Gate, and I knew thou wouldst as well. Forgive my continued meddling but I believe it is warranted, especially considering the pressures thou art no doubt confronting. My pestering of thee certainly pales in comparison to the influence thou hast felt from others, including thine own self. Gorion raised thee as best he could, but 'tis hard indeed to overcome what is bred in the bone. Much more so in this case, I would imagine.~
@9880  = ~So what is it you wish of me?~
@9881  = ~What do you know of Gorion?~
@9882  = ~What do you know of this? Why have you come here?~
@9883  = ~He was long my friend and we talked often, though less after he settled down with thee. He was quite the traveler in his day, though he never regretted his new role as foster father. He felt a stable childhood would better prepare thee for... well... the problems that would eventually come. He cared deeply for thee. I hope this was not lost on you.~

There are good people who are willing to guide thee, and options available other than capitulation.~
@9898  = ~He was a good man, though I would prefer to walk my own path.~
@9899  = ~I was not suggesting that thou should do otherwise. Whatever the motives, independence is always a wise course to follow. My worry is that thy lineage is harder to escape than most. Thou hast bad blood in thee, though Gorion did what he could to teach thee well and true. Thou hast hungry blood within thee as well, and it will not let thee go without a fight.

@9921  = ~I met Narlen back in the Thieves' Guild and he was none too pleased to see me. Rededge was killed by the city guards because I didn't call the alarm as I agreed to. Narlen asked for a rogue-duel as revenge, and his fellows threatened to join in if any other members of my party helped.

I have come to tell of the dark: You have a very special heritage, child, one that graces you with more enemies than friends, I fear. This city holds many secrets and dangers and, as you have rightly come to suspect, the Iron Throne lies somehow at the core of it all. Your investigations will not go unnoticed nor, like as not, unpunished. I urge you to curry the favor of Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist, as they are good men at heart and capable of providing you with some guidance and protection in this urban vast... But I tarry here too long. It is best we not be seen together.~
@9926  = ~I met Narlen and Rededge back at the Thieves' Guild after our run from the city guards. We successfully got away with the gold, but I don't wish to risk my neck in such a way again.~
@9927  = ~I met Narlen and Rededge back at the Thieves' Guild after we successfully fled from the city guards. We got the gold we went for, and have set our sights higher for tonight. A jewel fence named Gantolandan is our target, and we are to meet by the Blade and Stars to sort out the deed. We are to steal a rogue stone from the fence. Again, only a thief must be visible. All other party members must wait out of sight.~
@9928  = ~On tonight's job with Narlen and Rededge, I will be on the inside to do the stealing. Rededge will keep watch outside, and Narlen will watch my back. We meet back at the Guild once the deed is done.~
@9929  = ~Aye, I doubt it not. This city holds many secrets and dangers, especially for one with a heritage such as yours... As you have rightly come to suspect, the Iron Throne lies at the core of it all somehow. Your investigations will not go unnoticed nor, like as not, unpunished. I urge you to curry the favor of Scar and Duke Eltan, both of the Flaming Fist, as they are good men at heart and capable of providing you with some guidance and protection in this urban vast. But I tarry here too long. It is best we not be seen together.~
@9930  = ~I met Narlen back at the Thieves' Guild, but he was none too happy. We did not get the gems from Gantolandan, and this failure will likely cost me some respect among the thieves.~
@9931  = ~I met Narlen back at the Thieves' Guild and he was understandably happy. We successfully stole the gems from Gantolandan, and have split this rich treasure between us. I get the feeling that I have proved myself worthy of their respect, and am considered one of their own. Certainly this will help me in the future.~
@9932  = ~An old gent named Entillis Fulsom seems well-acquainted with my ongoing investigations into the Iron Throne. He has recommended to me the assistance of Scar and Duke Eltan, two men associated with the honorable Flaming Fist Mercenaries here in Baldur's Gate. It seems that he is acting with Elminster. While I still cannot grasp their interest in me, I cannot doubt the goodness of their intentions.~
@9933  = ~Well. I should say the mother and I expected to see you again at some point, though it was certainly not to be so soon. I suppose it's to collect some sort of payment for your actions outside of Baldur's Gate, hmmm?~
@9934  = ~It would seem my escapades with Narlen and Rededge gained me more than a few gold coins or some gems. Because I proved myself as a fellow thief worthy of the guild, Narlen stepped in to save my skin when I was threatened. It seems Alatos originally hired me because I was expendable, and he knew Resar would kill whoever did the job. Narlen wouldn't stand for it and killed Resar before I was in any danger. Alatos quickly agreed to spare me lest he face a number of mutinous thieves. I have made some valuable friends through all of this.~

@9936  = ~You do not ask for much, do you? Very well, take the child and go. I warrant you will no doubt resurrect him, but the lesson is learned. Death changes one, especially one so young. I know of this like no other. GO! And never darken these halls again... unless summoned!~
@9937  = ~HA! Hahahaha. It's an interesting and foolishly LARGE request from someone in your position. Umberlee neither required, nor sought your help. You were simply a toy for her amusement. Perhaps you can be such again? Since you did some service, needed or not, you have a small chance to leave. Here is the body you came for. If you can get to the front gate, you may leave. If you do not make it, you will join him. Even if you live, I trust I shall never see you again. Understand?~
@9938  = ~I suppose such brash and disrespectful behavior is to be expected from such a bloodthirsty lot. Very well, you may have the body you came for. No doubt you will raise him, but he will have learned. By this time Umberlee herself may have had a chat with him. Oh, one other thing... NEVER come here again unless summoned.~
@9939  = ~Pathetic. Whether true or not, it simply would not do for people to think Umberlee requires the assistance of such sniveling worms as yourselves. You seek the child? Here is the body. It is a simple game. You get as far as the front gate, you are worthy to have served the Water Queen and may take what you came for. If you do not get there, well, you shall be beyond worrying about it. Now, LEAVE!~
@9940  = ~You! Is it nerve that brings thee here?! No, more likely stupidity. Was it not you who turned thy back on Umberlee's cause? You have changed somewhat but it is you. I see with the mother's eyes! Your inaction was of little consequence, for the mother and I dealt well with all of them. Now you will join them!~
@9941  = ~Cease your blubbering. It is an insult to show such pathos in the sight of Umberlee! Perhaps we should make ye prove your mettle, that we might forget this sickening display? Here is the body you came for. If you can get to the front gate, you may leave. Of course my fellow waveservants will do their utmost to hinder your progress. It is sure to be an amusing diversion for the Sea Queen.~
@9942  = ~Do they now? It is not unlike how a child would miss its parent I imagine... Take him and begone. Do not expect such charity in the future, and do not return to this place unless summoned!~
@9943  = ~Some sage words indeed. You know your place in things well. Appropriate behavior should not go unrewarded. Here be the body you seek. No doubt your intention is to resurrect the child? No matter. The lesson will have been learned. Do not return here unless summoned. You shall find the reception more... chilling.~
@9944  = ~Do you not realize where you are? This is my very lair! This is the seat of Umberlee! You do not make demands here! Waveservants, dispose of this flotsam! I cannot stand the sight of them!~
@9945  = ~It has been decided you are to be safe here as need be. Umberlee hath no love for thee or thy cause, but hath an interest anyway. The inevitable chaos and turmoil that would follow a godly resurrection fall a touch too close to pleasing godly brethren like Talos. Anything that would amuse him is to be... discouraged. Come and go as you wish, but do not advertise the fact that you can.~

These components are the ingredients for creating a Halruaan flying ship, and the Halruaans want their secret preserved and the items stolen. Alatos suggested that I either "persuade" the daughters to release the items, or spirit them out from under their noses. The items are as follows: a spellbook that outlines the rituals needed, a statuette of indeterminate origin, and a fragment of a powerful artifact. I am to return to the Thieves' Guild when the items are in my possession.~

@9997  = ~I ran into old Feldane, one of the monks who has lived at Candlekeep since before I can remember. He said that there are suspicious visitors staying at the keep, and that they are making use of the meeting rooms.

@10008 = ~I have met Gregor, the son of Brunos, one of the murdered Iron Throne leaders.

Sarevok has apparently used the Throne's best plots to inflame the region instead of securing wealth and power. He now campaigns to become a duke on the premise that he will fight the chaos he himself created. What he hopes to accomplish once he is a duke no one seems to know. The region is perilously close to war though.~
@10009 = ~I have met Kalessia, an emissary supposedly from a far-off headquarters of the Iron Throne. She seemed surprised that Sarevok had taken control of this regional base. He is thought of as an upstart who does not have the interests of the Iron Throne at heart.~
@10010 = ~Sarevok is apparently almost as damaging to the Iron Throne as I am. He is using their resources to fund his rise to power in Baldur's Gate. He has also installed one of his lackeys as the new commander of the Flaming Fist, replacing Scar, who died suddenly. His goal is likely to become a Grand Duke, though what he hopes to achieve once he has, no one knows. Most of the citizenry believe him to be a saint, and it would take solid proof to convince them otherwise.~
@10011 = ~Sarevok is to be a Grand Duke, stepping in to replace Entar Silvershield, and he has the full support of the people. He has promised to restore order, and since he created the chaos I am sure he will be fairly successful. Some members of the Iron Throne would not be surprised if he was behind Entar's death. Likely the other Dukes are in similar peril. Sarevok seems bent on causing destruction, and the smallest diversion is crushed viciously. Is he pursuing war with Amn? What good would this do anyone?~
@10012 = ~Some of the Iron Throne members think that I was the unwitting dupe of Sarevok, as were they. It would seem that he sacrificed their leaders just to discredit me, knowing that I was perhaps the only one that stood in his way. Of course he also became the leader of the Iron Throne himself, but he seems quite beyond needing them now. His coronation is imminent, and will take place at the Ducal Palace.

@10102 = ~After defeating the mage Davaeorn, I questioned his sniveling apprentice, Stephan Re'Cap. He confirmed much of what I already knew: The Iron Throne is the organization behind the iron crisis, though I think their name is just a coincidence. Mulahey was to destroy the effectiveness of the Nashkel mines while bandits stopped incoming caravans. The perceived threat of the shortage likely inflamed fears and exaggerated the problem.

The Iron Throne was going to try to look like the saviors of the day, riding in with their stores of iron to equip the troops, or something like that. With the bandit raids and the rumors about Amn, the Iron Throne figured that the dukes of Baldur's Gate would think they needed arms and ore quickly in case of Amnian attack. They figured they could get exorbitant prices, or better yet, sanctions against competitors and an easing of trade laws for themselves only. A quick way to install themselves as an underground power on the coast while maintaining a veneer of respectability as a merchant consortium; unless they got caught, of course.

The three regional leaders of the Iron Throne placed Davaeorn in charge of the mine. Stephan also said that Davaeorn was getting orders from someone else too, and that he complained about it a lot, but he never said a name. The main building for the Iron Throne is apparently in Baldur's Gate, somewhere in the southwest part of the city.~
@10103 = ~Baldur's Gate is nearly a jail in these times. The entire city is on edge, and every member of the Flaming Fist is out for blood. Scar, their second-in-command, was killed recently and Duke Entar Silvershield was assassinated. Angelo Dosan is now effectively in control of the Flaming Fist, though no one seems to trust him. He's got powerful friends though, and I hear that he takes orders straight from Sarevok. Duke Eltan, the real head of the Flaming Fist, is barely clinging to life. No one seems to be able to help him, even though he is attended around the clock by a healer named Rashad. With Entar dead and Eltan ill, the other Dukes have called an emergency election. Sarevok is the frontrunner, and his stand against Amn is very popular. Confronting him directly will have to wait until I have concrete proof to present. No one would take my word over his. Perhaps I might have more luck investigating Angelo at the Flaming Fist headquarters.~
@10104 = ~The iron shortage wanes, but merchants are still without wares. It is the Iron Throne's instability which has prolonged the strife in the city, and that is why other merchants blame them. They were major importers, and without their help it will take much longer to reassure people that all is well. Since Sarevok has assumed control they have ceased most business transactions and frozen most of their assets. The fact that he is crippling a large merchant house seems inconsequential to him. He is disinterested, and seems likely to sacrifice it to fund the re-arming of Baldur's Gate, and thus his bid to become a Grand Duke. I cannot imagine sane businessmen following such directives. Something is very odd at the Iron Throne building indeed.~
@10105 = ~Sarevok has secured himself as leader of the Iron Throne, and is in the process of all but destroying its mercantile credibility by practically sacking it.

@10115 = ~Such people would not dare to show their faces in Baldur's Gate, not now that Sarevok and Angelo Dosan control the Flaming Fist. Order will be enforced, more so once Sarevok is appointed as a Grand Duke. I shall have little fear of the streets once that comes to pass.~
@10116 = ~The nobility is especially approving of Sarevok and Angelo Dosan being in control of the Flaming Fist. Sarevok has promised to restore order, and is using this stance to be appointed as a Grand Duke.~

@10119 = ~Duke Eltan slips closer to death's door and the government of Baldur's Gate is in shambles following Duke Entar Silvershield's death. Sarevok is stepping in proclaiming that he will make Amn pay. Amn denies they are behind the problems, but people are eager for a scapegoat.~
@10120 = ~Scar was killed, possibly murdered, and Duke Eltan is still too sick to lead the Flaming Fist. Angelo Dosan has stepped up to take the role, but he seems to be in the back pocket of Sarevok. Their association seems to be widely known, but Sarevok is so popular people do not seem to mind.~
@10121 = ~The whole city is on edge, and things are apparently really strange by the Iron Throne building. Sarevok has announced that he is assuming control of them, and he's going to use their resources to help reinforce the city against Amn. He's making a lot of friends, and will likely be nominated to replace the murdered Entar as Grand Duke.~
@10122 = ~Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated, and with Duke Eltan on his deathbed an election of sorts has been called. People feel they should not be without a full government in these dangerous times. Sarevok is apparently a frontrunner in this matter.~
@10123 = ~War with Amn is all but certain, especially once Sarevok takes the helm.~
@10124 = ~Sarevok is petitioning to be the newest Grand Duke, and who could possibly refuse him? He brings the resources of the fallen Iron Throne, and promises to prepare Baldur's Gate for war with Amn. No one seems to want to question him because he is instilling a sense of hope that has been lacking for a while. What he hopes to gain through causing a war, I do not know.~
@10125 = ~Duke Eltan is on death's door. He's got a healer with him always, but he doesn't seem to be getting any better. Rashad is the healer's name, and even though he seems well intentioned he is also apparently kind of weird.~
@10126 = ~Sarevok has sworn that he will stand firm against Amn, even pursuing war if that is what they wish. If he becomes a Grand Duke, he will have all the influence he needs to launch an attack. People don't seem to realize that the only person confirming Amn's intentions is Sarevok himself.~
@10127 = ~Duke Eltan, the leader of the Flaming Fist, is gravely ill; Scar, the second-in-command, is dead; and Grand Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated. People feel that they are under siege. The question to ask is, who could be behind it? Everyone says Amn, but some are not sure. Sarevok is my bet, but I need proof.~
@10128 = ~Sarevok did something to the members of the Iron Throne that are left, something strange.~
@10129 = ~Something is wrong in the Iron Throne building. People say that they are apparently acting strangely. More doppelgangers perhaps? I hope not.~
@10130 = ~Scar is dead, and his replacement Angelo is supposedly a puppet for Sarevok.~
@10131 = ~Duke Entar Silvershield is dead. With Duke Eltan sick they'll likely move Sarevok in, mostly because he's got the resources of the Iron Throne and he is intent on "punishing" Amn.~

I'll be tellin' the men to get back to work, we've got ore to mine! Still can't ship it for fear of bandits, but that ain't my problem. Best you tell the mayor of what you did here, 'cuz he'll likely give you a reward of some kind.~

@10171 = ~When asked about his past, MONTARON openly threatens you with bodily harm. He seems quite dangerous, and more than willing to engage in gratuitous violence. It would appear that he cares little for life, including his own. He works grudgingly with Xzar, even though he obviously despises the man. Whoever their employers are, they must be powerful indeed. These two would likely kill each other without a presence over their heads preventing it. Montaron might be willing to discuss the whole matter with you, but you get the feeling that you probably would not wake up the next morning.~
@10172 = ~When asked about his past, XZAR has very few coherent things to say. His desire to determine the cause of the iron shortage seems benevolent enough, but his motives remain unclear. His ramblings seem disjointed, but his faculties are obviously in good enough order for him to be adept at magic. He mutters something about how he and his associate Montaron are in the employ of a powerful group, but when pressed for details he gets extremely agitated and does not speak for some time. He is obviously at least partially insane, and the network that would hire him must be dark indeed.~

@10181 = ~When asked about his past, KIVAN reveals that he hails from the forest of Shilmista, though he has not visited his homeland for quite some time. He has instead been traveling the world driven by the darkest of obsessions: revenge. Kivan and his mate Deheriana were apparently on a romantic sojourn years ago when they were waylaid by a group of brigands. They were captured and tortured for the amusement of Tazok, the half-ogre that led the attack. Kivan eventually escaped, but Deheriana did not survive the encounter. Kivan is a man of few words, and obviously does not make friends easily. Likely he will not take much pleasure from life until he has revenged the death of his love.~
@10182 = ~Cleric/Ranger~
@10183 = ~When asked about her past, ALORA reveals that she was originally from Iriaebor. As a child she was cute, outgoing, and dangerously curious, causing no end of trouble for her parents. They tried to curb her lunatic behavior, and encouraged her to be content with home and hearth like other halflings. Alora found this unbearably stifling, and left to explore the world. She quickly found herself falling into all sorts of trouble, going to the wrong places and angering the wrong sorts of people. Eventually she found herself in the city of Baldur's Gate, and it was there that she discovered her future profession: thievery. Wealth was never her chief concern; it's just that too many interesting things are behind locked doors. Her unassuming temperament makes it easy for her to hoodwink the authorities, and her sweet nature has saved her from a jail cell numerous times.~
@10184 = ~Cleric/Thief~
@10185 = ~When asked about his past, MINSC proudly announces that he is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen in the Utter East. He is currently undertaking his dajemma, a ritual journey to manhood, and is seeking adventure and glory in battle. It is also his honor to be the bodyguard of a young Wychlaran of Rashemen named Dynaheir, and if anyone tries to harm her, he will beat sense into their heads until they reconsider. He is unsure as to why she has led them to the Sword Coast, but his loyalty is unquestioning. If he serves her well and distinguishes himself in battle, he hopes to be accepted into the Ice Dragon berserker lodge upon returning to their homeland. So far Minsc considers his most notable experience in the world abroad to be the acquisition of his animal companion Boo, a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist in the Realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head. He seems a good-natured fellow, but is all too willing to indulge his berserker nature.~

@10192 = ~When asked about her past, DYNAHEIR has very little to say. She is apparently from the far-eastern nation of Rashemen, and has come to the west with a bodyguard known as Minsc. Minsc is on his dajemma, a rite of passage, and it appears that she may be involved in something similar. Of this, she will only state that great things are foretold for the Sword Coast. She seems very sure of herself, is possessed with an old-world sensibility, and is very demanding of her companions. She has expressed concerns about the sanity of her bodyguard, though she has an obvious respect for him and will not go far from his side.~
@10193 = ~Mage/Thief~
@10194 = ~Paladin~
@10195 = ~When asked about his past, YESLICK quietly states that he was once a member of the dwarven clan Orothiar. For generations they used the iron mine in the center of Cloakwood as their home, but almost a century ago, catastrophe struck. As skilled as they are underground, dwarves occasionally make mistakes. One such incident cost them dearly. They apparently breached an underground river and the resulting flood claimed nearly all of the clan. Yeslick was one of the few survivors, and made his way to Sembia to start a new life. There he made the acquaintance of Rieltar, a member of the Iron Throne, and was hired as a personal smith. They became friends, and eventually Yeslick told of his past. This proved to be his undoing, as Rieltar used this information to formulate a plan to expand the Iron Throne power base in the Sword Coast. Rieltar betrayed his supposed friend and forced him to reveal the location of the mine. Yeslick has been imprisoned ever since so as not to reveal the site to others. Now he wishes for nothing but the chance to right the wrongs that have been committed using his ancestral home.~
@10196 = ~When asked about his past, CORAN reveals that he hails from the Forest of Tethir, and while he has great memories of his time there, the serene lifestyle he felt it offered was ultimately not for him. Instead he traveled to the city of Baldur's Gate, dreaming of wealth, power, and respect. With nary a coin to his name, he resorted to thievery, stealing only from those that he felt could spare it, and swearing that he would quit once he had enough gold to start his own business. Unfortunately, he soon grew to love his new lifestyle, looking forward to each hair-raising escape, dangerous break-in, or beautiful woman. Occasionally, he would need to leave town for a while, disappearing into the wilderness until things had cooled down and his name was less known. His most recent retreat is apparently the result of a relationship with the female sorceress Brielbara. He sheepishly admits to being caught in the act of seducing a female member of the Knights of the Unicorn and being forced to flee from the violently jealous mage.~
@10197 = ~When asked about his past, AJANTIS announces that he is a squire paladin of the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart, and that he enforces the power and discipline of Helm. He belongs to the noble family of Ilvastarr in Waterdeep and has studied swordplay under such luminaries as Myrmith Splendon. His skill and devotion apparently brought him to the attention of the paladin Keldorn, one of the most respected of the Order, who decided to take Ajantis under his wing as a squire.Recently Ajantis has asked for the honor of becoming a full-fledged member of the Order. To accomplish this, he has traveled to the Sword Coast in order to help curtail the increased humanoid activity in the region. If he succeeds in his quest, the Order will vote on his eligibility for membership. He seems utterly devoted to his mission.~
@10198 = ~When asked about his past, KHALID nervously reveals that he was born and raised in the nation of Calimshan. He does not say much of his parents, but you get the feeling that his merchant father thought little of him, devoting much more attention to Khalid's half-brothers. Khalid thus threw himself into the martial pursuits, studying under members of the city militia. He doesn't go into detail on how he met Jaheira, but his adoration of her is obvious. When asked about how he knew Gorion he will only say that they had long been friends, and that many shared acquaintances will mourn his loss with harpsong.~
@10199 = ~When asked about her past, JAHEIRA glares as she speaks. She says that she was born in the Tethyr region to a loyalist of the King Alemander regime, unfortunately during the Tethyrian civil war. Her family was among the nobles targeted by the angry mobs of peasants, and she was only spared because a servant girl took her from their castle before it fell. They fled into the forest of Tethyr and stumbled across an enclave of druids willing to take the child. Jaheira grew up a very headstrong girl, believing that the only way to protect nature was to have an active role in the world. She seems to have little in common with Khalid, but even though her manner is often confrontational, she apparently cares deeply for him. Her admiration of Gorion is obvious, and she plainly states that whomever was responsible for his death will suffer an equal fate.~
@10200 = ~When asked about his past, GARRICK explains that he was part of a celebrated acting troupe called the Dale Wind Troubadours. They traveled the length of the coast from Neverwinter to Amn and often played to Dukes and other nobility. Indeed, few others could afford the cost of a performance when the group was at its peak. Garrick does not speak fondly of this time however, as the direction the group was taking left him dissatisfied with their conduct. He apparently discovered that performances were being used as distractions for thievery and declared he would have nothing to do with it. Rebuffed by his comrades, now he wishes simply to travel and play his music for those that will listen. He seems a bit young and naive, and a touch too ready to take the word of a stranger.~
@10201 = ~When asked about her past, SAFANA spins tale upon tale involving fantastic liaisons with pirate captains, nobles, and royalty of all shapes and sizes. The consistent details seem to be that she grew up in the city of Calimport, surrounded by luxury. Her father was a very influential noble, and though she could have had anything, she apparently found herself too confined by her father's protective arm. She ran away in her early teens with the help of the first mate of the pirate ship "Exzesus," and remained with the crew for several years as they raided up and down the Sword Coast. Eventually she tried to manipulate the captain and found herself in a lot of trouble, escaping when the ship was at port in Baldur's Gate. She has many stories of her escapades after that, but if there is a grain of truth in them, you certainly cannot find it.~
@10202 = ~When asked about her past, FALDORN states that she was the child of a Black Raven Uthgardt woman. As an infant she was given over to an enclave of Shadow Druids as an offering, and was thereafter raised according to their beliefs. A splinter group of the main druidic order, Shadow Druids engage in very aggressive protection of nature, often relying on violence to achieve their aims. Faldorn showed great promise as she approached adulthood, and the order decided to send her to the Sword Coast to test her devotion to their ideals. Her ongoing mission is to use any means available to stop the despoiling of nature, no matter the risk or the cost to her life or any other.~
@10203 = ~When asked about her past, BRANWEN reveals that she left her home of Seawolf in the Norheim Isles at an early age. She was apparently reviled by her own people for wanting to become a priest, a station reserved exclusively for the men of the village. She harbors no resentment, realizing that her faith must face such tests or be worthless. She traveled the coast, offering her services to local militias, and eventually came into the employ of an adventuring troup in the Nashkel area. Branwen had no idea that the group was participating in banditry, however, and on their first raid, she balked at attacking a caravan of unarmed merchants. She rebelled, and a mage named Tranzig turned her to stone in the ensuing fight. Despite the unfavorable outcome, Branwen feels that Tempus views her actions approvingly. To attack those that are unarmed is the basest of villainy.~
@10204 = ~When asked about his past, QUAYLE talks for a good hour about his worship of Baravar Cloakshadow, how he is well on his way to mastering sorcery, and just generally how incredibly smart he is compared to everyone else in the party. He was apparently encouraged to strike out on his own as soon as he came of age because, as he claims, he was simply too gifted to remain in that stifling environment. You get the feeling, however, that no one was terribly broken up over his leaving. He says that he apprenticed in the arts of magic and the worship of Baravar under a gnome named Gifos, though it was not long before this teacher also sent him on his way. Since then, Quayle has wandered the Sword Coast looking for people who were willing to accept his "wisdom and instruction." It has likely been a long walk.~
@10205 = ~When asked about his past, XAN wistfully speaks of his home in the elven stronghold of Evereska, and his role as a Greycloak. It was apparently decreed that he was to investigate the events of the iron shortage, determine who or what were the causes, and ascertain whether there was a greater threat to the region as a whole. This was definitely not a small task, and he accepted the responsibility with a great deal of dread. You get the feeling, however, that he approaches everything with a great deal of dread. He has devoted his life to improving his mastery of magic and has become a skilled wizard, though this dedication has left him little time to make friends or acquire any other pastimes. He strikes you as very capable, though probably not the best influence on morale.~

@10207 = ~When asked about her past, SKIE bubbles that she is the daughter of Entar Silvershield, one of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. Her admittedly sheltered life has consisted mostly of learning ballet, history, and languages. Being exceptionally agile, she has become a very proficient dancer, though this natural dexterity has mainly allowed her to better sneak off on sojourns away from the estate. She says she finds the nastier areas of Baldur's Gate exciting, though she seems naive about the dangers. On one of her escapades she met up with the debonair Eldoth, and thinks that he can help her live the life of adventure that she craves. She trusts him implicitly, perhaps too much so.~
@10208 = ~When asked about his past, ELDOTH speaks as though his every word should impress and dazzle. He really seems to enjoy talking about himself. He is apparently from the island kingdom of Ruathym, though he left as a teenager for the city of Waterdeep. His natural affinity for song and poetry was honed to perfection while he trained at the musical college of New Olamn, supporting himself with gold borrowed from any one of his given lovers. It would seem that his skill in music is mirrored with his talent in the manipulation of others' emotions. He skims over explaining how he came to leave Waterdeep, but it was apparently the result of an attempted tryst with Aleena Paladinstar. Piergeiron, lord of the city, discovered that his daughter was being used by a manipulative dilettante and likely became quite furious. Eldoth probably had to flee the city, deciding it was time to use his bardic skills elsewhere.~

@10213 = ~When asked about his past, TIAX ignores you entirely, preferring instead to loudly proclaim what is in store for his future. He obviously worships Cyric, but also seems to share a touch of his madness. Tiax unquestioningly believes that he is destined to rule the world, and his fervor makes him blind to the ridiculous nature of the goal. He seems harmless enough for now.~
@10214 = ~When asked about his past, KAGAIN stresses that the questioner should just mind their own business if they want to keep their teeth. It is apparent that he runs a rather shady mercenary company and that he is quite obsessed with wealth, but any information beyond this he is content to keep to himself.~
@10215 = ~When asked about her past, SHAR-TEEL has very little to say. From the little she speaks of it, it can be gleaned that she is an orphan. She also seems to harbor an intense dislike for Flaming Fist mercenaries, as well as an obvious disrespect for men in general. She seems to have something to prove, and likely her childhood was not of storybook quality.~
@10216 = ~When asked about his past, EDWIN sneers that he has no intention of revealing such information and that it is none of your business. He further states that you are lucky enough to simply share his company, and then mutters something about leaving whenever he wishes. He obviously cares little for the camaraderie of others, and seems to take more pleasure in speaking to himself than in interacting with the party. His attire brazenly displays the colors of the Red Wizards of Thay, though why a member of that organization would come so far west is puzzling. Edwin does not seem forthcoming with any information.~
@10217 = ~When asked about her past, VICONIA reveals (quite proudly) that she is a dark elf from the Underdark city of Menzoberranzan. She says very little about her reasons for leaving that sunless realm, though separations of such a nature are never gentle. She does claim to no longer worship the spider goddess Lolth, a change that even you know is often fatal. Her new faith is in the night goddess Shar, an appropriate choice for a drow, though this is not a firm indication that she has given up the brutal ways of her people. She finds the laws of the surface world quaint and more than a little strange, but this is simply because of her lack of experience. Likewise, she seems a bit naive about how her race is viewed by surface-dwellers. Many will not give her the chance she seems to expect, and even being seen with her may affect how people think of you. You know that as a drow, she has resistance to magic.~

She apparently came to Candlekeep much as you did, though ten years later in life, and she spent much more time with the gruff Winthrop than Gorion. "Puffguts," she would call him, much to the old innkeep's dismay. She seems the eternal child, and is quite content to play the part of little sister, though you are both of comparable ages.

Who wields the blade is now unknown, but its recovery would aid greatly in fighting the current spider infestation that plagues the Cloakwood.

For those of you with a limited vocabulary, petrified means "turned to stone." Anyhow, one of those adventurers had in his possession an item of power: the Helm of Balduran. Ramazith didn't know this at the time and so, after turning them all to stone, he simply sold their bodies to an art collector living in the heart of Baldur's Gate.

@10430 = ~Good! My name is Rill, and I'm the de facto leader of the slaves here beneath the Cloakwood. I heard about you, because I'm always careful to listen to what the Blacktalons talk about. It seems that the Iron Throne has placed a large price on the head of someone named <CHARNAME>, which would be you, I assume. Enough introductions, we don't have much time. I need 100 gold. The captain of the Blacktalons on the first floor is not known for his loyalty to the Throne.

@10441 = ~A stupid story! Why should I believe a mere slave?~
@10442 = ~Believe what you want.~
@10443 = ~Good! If you haven't already been down to the lower levels, try to find a man named Rill. He's a good friend of mine, and should be able to come up with a plan on how to get all of the slaves to safety. I'll see you later then, and try not to get killed.~
@10444 = ~Hey there again. I see that you have the key. It must have been a bloody battle with the master, and you must be tough ones to have lived through it. All right then, give the key and let's be done with this. Oh, one more thing, you did talk to Rill, didn't you? So that all of the slaves could get out of here alive.~
@10445 = ~Who cares about the other slaves?! Just open the plug so that we can flood this place and get out of here.~

@10447 = ~I'm not a murderer! There's no way that I'm going to open this plug and drown all my friends in the mine! Talk to Rill, and then you come back and talk to me.~
@10448 = ~Well, then I guess that's it then. As soon as I open the plug, we're going to have to run for our lives, 'cause otherwise we'll be washed away just like the Orothiar dwarves. Ready then? Here we go!~
@10449 = ~We don't want to drown the mine just yet. Stay around here, and we might come back for you later.~

@10497 = ~Suit yourself, though I can't say as I blame ya. Very useful stuff, that. Say, how about I have a seamstress weave it within a cloak for ye? It is said that the wearer of such an item is magically more beautiful. It would not cost much, perhaps 100 gold. Delicate stuff, it is.~

@10531 = ~Indeed? Well, I cannot help you; I do not have that item. Perhaps one of my fellows carries such a thing, but I know not. If you rescue them as you did me I am sure you will find it, though I would soften your tone. Some of my companions take offense easily.~
@10532 = ~Hmm, I do not have such a thing in my possession, though one of my companions may. I cannot say for certain though, as I have not known them for long. Not counting the time spent petrified with them, of course.~

@10534 = ~My price shall be your death if I do not receive the Helm of Balduran!~

@10536 = ~Such manners! Your bluster is wasted; I do not have the item you seek. Perhaps one of my petrified fellows might, but that will be their business to take up with you. Please feel free to question them, as you will. I have shared much with them, but I care not for what baubles they have stashed in their packs.~
@10537 = ~If I had such a thing, I would not think your offer a worthwhile trade. My life for such a powerful item? You will not find many that peaceably accept such terms. Feel free to examine my fellows though. They might respond otherwise.~
@10538 = ~Wha—? Get back! Who are ye? More of Ramazith's trickery, or are ye paired with that snake Degrodel? I swear none shall see the day when I get between feuding mages ever again! Well? Speak up! Are ye for me or against me?~
@10539 = ~I am neither, as I care little for you at all. I released you to find the Helm of Balduran.~
@10540 = ~I saved you from your prison of stone, did I not? I ask only one thing for this: that you give me the Helm of Balduran.~
@10541 = ~I see. Well, I do not have such an item, nor would I tell you if I did. Dead with a treasure would be better than living without. Question the others if ye will; I care only that I can walk once more.~
@10542 = ~I suppose such a request is reasonable, though I cannot fulfill it. I do not have such a thing, though you may ask the others in my party. Perhaps they know where this helm can be found, though if it were me, I would not tell you. Such a treasure is worth dying for.~
@10543 = ~I awake from dark slumber and see before me... a deva? Certainly you must be such a creature to have rescued me. My name is Vail. Please honor me with your name as well.~

@10547 = ~You may not! Your answer confirms what I thought! You must have the helm!~
@10548 = ~I was hired by Degrodel to retrieve it. He said you hapless chaps would have it, and would perhaps trade it for your freedom.~
@10549 = ~You are that set in your path? So be it. I do own that item. It is mine won fair and square through hard work and honest labor. If you intend to take it, I will first ask you to reconsider. We are both adventuring sorts, whether hired or driven by spirit. You can see why I should not like to let my prize go, can't you?~
@10550 = ~That is what he said? Well, he was wrong. As much as I am grateful for your help, the item you seek is very important to me. I earned it through hard work, and take good care of it. Am I to relinquish such a historical curiosity that means so much to me? I ask you to reconsider. We are both adventuring sorts, whether hired or driven by spirit. Leave me my prize; you know I well deserve it.~

Quenash, my beautiful fallen saint, holds my cloak as a reminder of me. My helm I will trust only to my guile in hiding it.

He... he did mention something about hiding it. What was it he said? He said that he could not have found a better location to hide both the cloak and the helm, and that the building was practically named for the purpose, but that he would let me keep the cloak because he did not want both items in such a public place.

Magic remains an uncertain force, and care must be taken in its use.~

@10720 = ~Hmm... a noble goal, and one that my fellow Shadow Druids will no doubt support. You should have an escort however, just to make sure you do more good than harm. I recommend you speak with Faldorn; she will gladly share your fervor in exterminating those that poison these woods to the east. Go now, and seek her aid.~
@10721 = ~Your contempt of me is just a reflection of your contempt of nature! You and the others that dare to mine within these woods will all fall before the wrath of the Shadow Druids!~
@10722 = ~Who dares presume to trespass upon nature's territory whilst a Shadow Archdruid looks on? Who could be so hungry for death? More of Seniyad's weakling pawns no doubt! How he can be one of the three with his pacifist attitudes is beyond logic!~
@10723 = ~I do not have to justify myself to you! Stand aside!~
@10724 = ~Dradeel~
@10725 = ~I dare to go where I wish! You cannot stop me!~
@10726 = ~My apologies, but we are hunting those that would destroy nature. Is there a bandit installation near here?~
@10727 = ~Pardon my ignorance, but what is an Archdruid?~
@10728 = ~Ignorance is never to be pardoned! Lessons hard learnt are the ones best remembered. I shall enlighten you, and then pose my question again. I am an Archdruid of the Shadow Druids, one of the few with my level of experience, and it is our duty to purge nature of outsiders. Druidic orders that think people can exist alongside nature are doomed to fail. We shall restore nature to its former glory the only way possible: active aggression! So again I put it to you: who are you to dare trespass in nature's territory?~
@10729 = ~Obe~
@10730 = ~Obe~
@10731 = ~Canderous~
@10732 = ~Canderous~
@10733 = ~Mordaine~
@10734 = ~Mordaine~

@10737 = ~Arkanis~
@10738 = ~Deder~
@10739 = ~Deder~
@10740 = ~Enough of your lectures! Get out of my way!~
@10741 = ~You seek to destroy that which those heathens have built? Perhaps you warrant temporary passage then, though you shall still be under my scrutiny. You may find a human fortress to the east, inhabited by those who call themselves the Iron Throne. It would be best if one of our own accompanied you, to be sure that your intent is true. Seek the one named Faldorn; she will join your cause. Her rage at those who would defile this land can barely be contained, and will no doubt benefit your cause. Go now; do not tarry in places you do not belong.~
@10742 = ~<CHARNAME>, the Gatewarden "arsked" me to prepare a little going away party for you! A bit of mass combat practice is in order, I believe. Well I'll make it real simple for you. Canderous, Mordaine, Arkanis, Deder and Osprey are all going to join your party. You'll have complete control over them, same as you will with anyone else who might join you in your coming travels.~
@10743 = ~I seek those that have polluted this wood. They are barely worth of the title "bandit"!~
@10744 = ~Once they've all joined your party, I'm going to summon in several illusions of common monsters you might encounter outside the safety of this Keep. These illusions will attack the party and it will be up to you to issue the necessary orders to dispose of them. Remember, these creatures are illusions and they won't be able to hurt you. Try your best to kill them, however, because in the real world, pain, harm, and even death are far more real.~
@10745 = ~Seniyad's followers are well known to me; you travel with the one known as Jaheira. Her naive views of society living in harmony with nature must be cleansed from the world, so that nature might regain the respect it deserves! As a Shadow Archdruid it falls to me to be the sickle that cleaves your parasitic taint from this forest! There will be no talking, no negotiation!~
@10746 = ~Some of your comrades will have magic items such as potions and wands. You'll have to equip these in the quick slots of the characters who have them. Some of them also have spells. You can cast these during the battle. Remember, even thieves and fighters can benefit from a good understanding of these more arcane forms of combat.~
@10747 = ~Every so often, I will ask you if you've had enough. If you have, then I shall teleport you back outside. If you wish to continue practicing, however, then I shall create some more illusions for you to fight. Are you ready then? Good, here we go!~
@10748 = ~Have you had enough yet? If you're ready to go, I'll teleport you back outside, otherwise you better be ready for some more fighting.~
@10749 = ~Bring on some more monsters, I'm not ready to quit yet.~
@10750 = ~I think I've had enough. Just take me outside.~
@10751 = ~Okay then. Once I teleport you outside, you're not going to be able to get back in here again. This is for your own protection, as the illusions I use can sometimes be dangerous.~
@10752 = ~Good! Then I will create some more illusionary monsters. This time I'll create some xvarts. Xvarts are primarily mountain-dwelling creatures, but they can be often found on the Coastway. Also, if you would like to use that wand in Osprey's possession, then simply right click on its icon in her inventory. This will bring up a description of the wand. There will be a button at the bottom of that page that says "Identify." Press that button to identify the wand and you will then be able to place it in Osprey's Quick Item slot where she can make use of it in combat. Whenever a mage in your party has the Identify spell memorized, just remember to put the item in his inventory and repeat the instructions that I've given you.~
@10753 = ~Have you had enough yet? If you're ready to go, I'll teleport you back outside, otherwise you better be ready for some more fighting.~
@10754 = ~Who dares presume to trespass upon nature's territory whilst a Shadow Archdruid looks on? Who could be so hungry for death... wait. I recognize you as those that travel with Faldorn. She has served the Shadow Druids well, and if she deems you worthy to share her cause, then you shall have free passage. Do not delude yourselves into thinking you have gained our favor. Such alliances are as fickle as the gusting wind.~
@10755 = ~Good! Then I'll create some more illusionary monsters. This time I'm going to create some skeletons. Try to hold them at bay using Osprey's Turn Undead ability. To do this, just press down on the Skull icon that appears on her toolbar.~
@10756 = ~Bring on some more monsters, I'm not ready to quit yet.~
@10757 = ~I think I've had enough. Just take me outside.~
@10758 = ~Have you had enough yet? If you're ready to go, I'll teleport you back outside, otherwise you better be ready for some more fighting.~

@10760 = ~I think I've had enough. Just take me outside.~
@10761 = ~Good! Then I'll create some more illusionary monsters. I'm creating kobolds this time. They have bows, so you may have to use a different technique to fight them.~
@10762 = ~Have you had enough yet? If you're ready to go, I'll teleport you back outside, otherwise you better be ready for some more fighting.~
@10763 = ~You are friends of Jaheira, are you not? She is of the druidic order that follows Seniyad, one of the three archdruids. Well, I do not share their philosophy! It is because of their pacifist doctrines that atrocities against nature continue, like the fool to the northwest that entraps animals and enslaves them for his petty tasks! As a Shadow Druid I fight so that nature is left untouched, there is no room for society to live along side! This must be enforced through fear, and the removal of the naive taint Jaheira and her kind have sown!~
@10764 = ~Bring on some more monsters, I'm not ready to quit yet.~
@10765 = ~I think I've had enough. Just take me outside.~
@10766 = ~Good! Then I'll create even more illusionary monsters. This time I'll create some tasloi. These creatures are usually only found in forests. But then again, Cloakwood is only a few days' travel north of Candlekeep.~
@10767 = ~I think that's enough fighting for the day. You're starting to look pretty tired and my magical abilities have been stretched to very near their limit. I'm going to teleport you outside now, and I think it would be good if you went and talked to your foster father, Gorion. You won't be able to reenter these cellars once I teleport you out. That's for your own safety as sometimes the aftermath of my illusions can be dangerous.~
@10768 = ~Have you had enough yet? If you're ready to go, I'll teleport you back outside, otherwise you better be ready for some more fighting.~
@10769 = ~Bring on some more monsters, I'm not ready to quit yet.~
@10770 = ~I think I've had enough. Just take me outside.~
@10771 = ~Good! Then I'll create some more illusionary monsters.~
@10772 = ~Faldorn travels with you, and so you shall live to see the glory of tomorrow's sunrise. If she can stand your presence, then so shall I. Perhaps you even share her Shadow Druid temperament. If so, you will want to know this: there is a fool in a cave to the northwest that dares to enslave the animals of this wood for his petty tasks. I shall give Faldorn the honor of feeding him to his own captives.~
@10773 = ~Soon be gone, will ye? Aye, Gorion arsked me to teach you a whit about the finer arts o' mass combat 'afore ye leave. Can I pique yer int'rest with it, <CHARNAME>?~
@10774 = ~Yes, Gatewarden. I would appreciate that.~
@10775 = ~You've the audacity of an ogre mage, the way you strut through this wood! Well, you'll not get much further than this if your purpose here does not counter the damage you might do to nature! Who do you claim to be and why should I let you pass?~
@10776 = ~Gorion's in a hurry, Gatewarden, and I'm afraid I can't spare the time. Sorry...~
@10777 = ~Are ye sure, little one? It would be best ye took the time to learn it now rather than curse yer ignorance later. Gorion himself arsked me to do this deed and I'll not offer it to ye twice.~
@10778 = ~Very well, then. Teach me what you can for I have much to learn.~
@10779 = ~Whatever little knowledge I have, I am sure it will be sufficient, thank you. Besides, Gorion will protect me should we encounter any trouble.~
@10780 = ~Aye, ye be as ye've always been, then. Worse than tryin' to talk sense to Ulraunt, himself. Now there be duties that need attendin' to and I'll not suffer a brat like ye any longer.~
@10781 = ~Good, then, child. 'Tis one thing to maintain control o' yerself in the heat of battle but 'tis quite another to maintain one's authority o'er a group. I've arsked Obe the illusionist to run through a few simulations fer ye down in the storage cellars. Just follow me this way an' I'll unlock the door fer ye...~
@10782 = ~There ye be, <CHARNAME>. If you haven't trained with Obe yet, then the door's wide open and all ye needs to do is drag yer cursor o'ertop it. If you've already done yer training then you should go and see Gorion. Yer father is anxious to see you.~
@10783 = ~I "claim" to be someone you should not bother. I wouldn't want to have to hurt you.~
@10784 = ~I beg of you, let me pass. There are villains in these woods that will do it more harm than I. I must track them down.~
@10785 = ~I don't mean the forest any harm. I simply wish to walk amongst the trees and enjoy their majesty.~
@10786 = ~It is fools like you who do the most harm! The trees were not placed for your enjoyment, and to treat them as mere entertainment is to demean them in ways I cannot stand! No Shadow Druid would ever condone such flagrant squandering of the gifts of the earth! I shall avenge each flower you might have trod on, and every leaf you might have shaken loose in your passing!~
@10787 = ~Contrariwise, I would love to have to hurt you! Your attitude only proves that you should not be allowed to proceed through this wood! Likewise you should not be allowed to live, lest you walk through some other wood in the future! Shadow Druids such as I are the last line of defense, and must protect nature against brutes like you!~
@10788 = ~Hello there! I thought I should tell you that Gorion has been looking to talk to <CHARNAME> and all of his friends. You should go talk to Gorion as soon as possible.~
@10789 = ~You display the same fervor that drives the other Shadow Druids and I. Perhaps there is merit in letting you continue. You might even prove useful. There is an infidel in a cave to the northwest of here that dares to capture creatures of the wood and bend them to his petty purposes. No doubt you would like to see him fed to his captives as much as I. Please proceed, and dispose of him at your leisure.~

@10799 = ~As you order, so shall it be, my old comrade. Come, Deder... <CHARNAME> has spoken.~
@10800 = ~They were right about you, <CHARNAME>. You've become a monster... I know not what forces chase you in these depths, but two have just joined their number! Come, Deder... in Gorion's good name.~
@10801 = ~Move along friends, nothing to see here. Just a humble woodsman doing a little spelunking.~

Dual-classing is a significant change to your character. Please be sure you have read and understand the following, as well as the description given in the manual.

Dual-classing is an ability that only humans have. It is the process by which you stop advancing in your current class and begin advancing in a second class. You will retain the benefits and abilities of the first class at its current level, but from then on you will only gain experience in the second.
In order to become dual-classed you must be of at least 2nd level in your current class. Your character must have scores of 15 or higher in the prime requisites of your current class, and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of the class you wish to change to. Some classes cannot be combined due to alignment conflicts or inherent restrictions. Within Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn all resulting mixes must be viable multi-class combinations as well.

Dual-class characters have much the same requirements as multi-class characters. You must abide by the restrictions of the individual classes. For example: a mage combination cannot cast spells while wearing armor, a thief combination cannot use thieving skills wearing other than leather armors, and a cleric or druid combination cannot use weapons that their ethos does not allow.

When you gain a level, you will have the option to change to a second class, provided you have the prerequisites and do not have any alignment conflicts. Your first class becomes "inactive" and you begin again at 1st level with 0 experience points in your second class. From then on you progress as a single-classed character in your new class. ONCE YOU HAVE CHANGED TO A SECOND CLASS YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO THE FIRST. Your first class will forever remain at its current level.

You will be unable to use the abilities of your first class until you have attained ONE LEVEL HIGHER in your new class. For example: If you were a 10th level mage and switched to a fighter, you would not be able to use your mage abilities again until you reached 11th level as a fighter

IMPORTANT: The experience cap in Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is 8,000,000 points for a single character. Experience points from BOTH of a dual-classed character's classes count towards this total. Please be sure that there are sufficient points left available to allow you to progress high enough in your second class! IF YOU ARE LEVEL 14 IN YOUR CURRENT CLASS, IT IS VERY LIKELY YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REACH LEVEL 15 IN A SECOND CLASS. The game will still allow you to dual if you wish, but you may not be able to access your previous class' abilities within Baldur's Gate II. This may result in difficulty later in the game. Possible future expansions may allow you to reach a higher level, and exporting your character in a sequel would also offer opportunity for advancement.~
@10812 = ~This is an odd place to meet a woodsman. Are you not afraid of those baby wyverns behind you?~
@10813 = ~Have you seen any bandits or otherwise untrustworthy people around?~
@10814 = ~Subterranean trees? Are you quite sure you know what you're talking about?~
@10815 = ~You just don't know the subtleties of wood and wood-related activities. These creatures are docile and... and it is worth the risk. Um... even the darkest of caves can be a rewarding experience for the woodsman that knows how to handle himself. Why... um... subterranean trees can yield the best material for carving... ahhh... ornamental... things.~
@10816 = ~What are you doing here? Tell me now, before I kill you!~
@10817 = ~Alrighty then, I shall leave you to your work. Far be it from me to get between a man and his wood... so to speak.~
@10818 = ~I think you are lying to me! Give one reason why I shouldn't kill you!~
@10819 = ~Bandits? Why would you be looking for bandits? Not that I've seen any, of course. It's been pretty quiet around here. Just my wyverns and... I mean, just THESE wyverns and me. Nothing out of the ordinary at all. Are you implying something?~
@10820 = ~I see that you have no use for beating around the bush. Well, so be it. I cast aside my master woodsman facade. You have interrupted my little wyvern-training session and likely set my schedule back by days. I have worked long and hard to gain their trust, but if I they are to be ready for duty at the mine I shall have to placate these beasts with meat! Fight, for you shall die if you lose!~
@10821 = ~Certainly! Have I given cause for you to doubt me? Of course not! Everything is just as it should be. There is nothing untoward about me or my wyver... I mean, there is nothing untoward about THESE wyverns. Are you implying something?~
@10822 = ~Nothing at all. I'll be on my way.~
@10823 = ~Do your actions not seem odd to you?~
@10824 = ~A pity you had not made that decision before you entered my little sanctuary. I suspect by your questions that you have doubts about my identity, and I cannot let you leave if you are going to tell others of me. I cannot have more interruptions. You have already set back my little training session just by being here. If I am to have these beasts ready to serve in the mines I must soothe them with meat, meat that you will provide!~
@10825 = ~Um... not at all. It is not uncommon for... for a woodsman to seek the comfort of natural caverns and... and... oh to blazes with it! I can tell by your questions that you suspect me of lying and I tire of this ruse! No, I am not a simple woodsman! I am training these beasts to serve as guards, and now that you have interrupted me I shall never have them ready for the mine. Your presence has agitated them; they will be unmanageable for days now! Perhaps... perhaps I can placate them with meat. Your meat!~
@10826 = ~Nothing at all. I'll be on my way.~
@10827 = ~Do your actions not seem odd to you?~

@10831 = ~You failed to copy the spell to your mage book.~
@10832 = ~I ain't gonna serve you another drop, you can barely stand as it is. Best you sleep it off before you go out lookin' for trouble.~
@10833 = ~Blast you all thrice over! I don't know who you be, but if you are in league with him that cut me down you can all go straight to Hades! May the spirits of those that built this maze take you down!~
@10834 = ~No, I fell on my own sword and damn near cut my own throat you fool! Of course he was here! The mad jackal had clear passage past me and still he paused to strike. I get the last laugh though. Traps ahead will get him even with that mage he was dragging along, and you too if you follow.~
@10835 = ~You've got me best wishes if you are hunting him down. Flew by me, he did, and only paused to stick me for the fun of it. Vicious bastard, he is. The traps ahead will likely claim him, even with that mage he was dragging along with him.~
@10836 = ~Shut your yap! I am looking for the one called Sarevok! Did he come this way?~
@10837 = ~Where does this passage lead?~
@10838 = ~You look injured. Who has done this to you?~
@10839 = ~I mean you no harm. I am only here to find Sarevok.~
@10840 = ~Who? Sarevok it was! I recognized him from when I was... ehhh... "exploring" the Iron Throne base the other day. I'll be alright, he was in too much of a hurry to do a proper job on me. You've got my blessings if you're tracking him down.~
@10841 = ~Cannot save during a store.~
@10842 = ~Bah, I'm sure I can handle it.~
@10843 = ~Where does it lead? You want to follow him? You'll be dead before you get hundred feet, but I guess it's your life. The maze apparently connects to the Undercity, but I ain't heard of nobody that has gone through and lived to tell. It's kinda meant as a decoy retreat of sorts. Lead intruders down here and they think it's the way out. Usually you don't see them again after that. Ain't seen a live person leave ever. She's full o' undead and kept clean by jellies. Better get a move on if you hope to catch them. I'm just going to stay here and catch my breath.~
@10844 = ~Fitting last words if ever I have heard them. Go on then; run along. If you make it through to the Undercity alive I will be more than surprised. No skin off my nose either way, though I'd love to see you run Sarevok through. I'll just wait here to hear about it though, if you don't mind. I ain't fool enough to run that gauntlet in there. The maze has not seen a live person pass since it was built. Maintained by her undead creators you know. Cleaned by jellies too. Better get a move on. Off you go.~
@10845 = ~Could you guide me through the maze so I can find him?~
@10846 = ~I do not need your blessings! He will not escape me!~
@10847 = ~Not permitted to buy/sell items.~
@10848 = ~HA!... er... I mean, no. No, I won't be doing that. I ain't ever seen anyone walk out of that maze alive. Not that you won't survive or anything. I bet you just waltz through without a problem. Yes sir. I'll just wait here to hear about it though. I ain't got no wish to meet the undead that maintain her, nor the jellies that keep her clean. Gotta... gotta catch my breath, you understand.~
@10849 = ~Would you be able to guide me through the traps ahead?~
@10850 = ~Traps be damned! They will not escape me!~
@10851 = ~-cough- Well well, I thought it would be you. Quite the little family reunion shaping up now, isn't it? I knew you would follow; you two are of the same blood. You must take the fight to him, lest he strike you down at his leisure. Not that it will matter; you have already beaten him. His plans are in ruins and his allies are fleeing in droves. Such glorious goals they were, though none understood the true desire behind them. None but me, that is. Unfortunately I am now expendable, but I expected no less.~
@10852 = ~What was your role in this? Why did you help him if you knew you were to be cast aside?~
@10853 = ~Where has he gone? He cannot hope to hide from me!~
@10854 = ~What did he hope to gain by all of this? He must have known that inciting war with Amn would eventually expose him!~
@10855 = ~What was my role? I was Sarevok's mentor, and tutored him in the blackest of rituals. If he were to succeed there is no doubt I would be among the dead, but my name would live on in his wake. There are things beyond death if you die in the right fashion, and how could there not be a place in history for the architect that shaped the actions of the ascending Lord of Murder? You would not understand; you were born to affect the Realms. The rest of us must carve our own place by whatever means necessary.~
@10856 = ~You arrogant fool! Your death will be much deserved!~
@10857 = ~Oh, Sarevok is not intent on hiding. You have stripped him of any pretense; there is no longer any point in him maintaining his respectable veneer. Only the most fanatical or fearful of his allies stand by him now. He will gather what resources he can and move on. Of course he knows that you must come to confront him and that it is to his advantage to choose the battleground. There is an altar in the Undercity; it was to be where the ritual would take place, but now serves as his last refuge. If you do not go to him, he will strike at you at his leisure.~
@10858 = ~I would kill you, but perhaps the anonymity you have attained is punishment enough. Get out of my sight!~
@10859 = ~Where has he hidden himself? I will end this tonight!~
@10860 = ~You must know his plan by now. You have practically followed his every move. Likely you are driven by the same desires as well, though you have channeled them in a different fashion. No, war with Amn was not his true goal; Sarevok is no profiteer. The slaughter was all he wanted, with enough lives lost in the initial battles to ignite the fire in his own divine blood. He thought death on the appropriate scale would cause him to ascend. Perhaps he would have, but who can really say? If you have the arrogance of a god and can kill like a god, who's to say you are not a god?~
@10861 = ~Ascending? What was he planning? The war with Amn makes no sense.~
@10862 = ~Ritual? What was he planning? The war with Amn makes no sense.~
@10863 = ~And what of you? Are you not valuable enough to keep by his side?~
@10864 = ~Footy~
@10865 = ~And your role in this atrocity? Who are you to Sarevok?~
@10866 = ~I will prove he is not! Where has he gone to hide?~
@10867 = ~I am dead regardless. Sarevok left me here for my "failure" earlier. He wished me to dispatch the Grand Dukes, rather than effect his escape as I did. He would not consider failing as a probability: a common weakness in those that would be gods. He will come for me when he realizes his first strike did not kill me. Do as you will; I am resigned to my fate whether it comes now or later.~
@10868 = ~Such threats are hollow, and you shall die first!~
@10869 = ~Monstrous! You will die for your part in this!~
@10870 = ~Your "charity" is admirable. You have definitely taken a separate path than Sarevok, though I wonder if it shall truly matter in the end. Leave me, I am no longer a threat to you or anyone. I'm just going to rest here a while.~
@10871 = ~You shall live to see all of his plans crumble.~
@10872 = ~His plans are in shambles. You will live to be accountable for your part in this!~

@10940 = ~MAGE: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, he studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of his time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive.

CAUTION: No matter what class a mage is combined with, they can NEVER cast spells while wearing armor.~
@10941 = ~THIEF: To accomplish his goals, for good or ill, the thief is a skilled pilferer. Cunning, nimbleness, and stealth are his hallmarks.

@10942 = ~A wizard who concentrates his efforts in a single school of magic is called a specialist. The number of spells they can cast increases, but they lose the ability to cast spells of the school in opposition to their specialty.

There could be several reasons why you may not be able to choose one of the above: You may be below 2nd level (in which case you cannot choose any), there may be alignment conflicts with your current class, you might have insufficient stat scores for their prime requisites, or the new class may just not be a viable option (the resulting mix must always be a valid multi-class combination).~

@10992 = ~It's about time you got out here, Prat! It is Prat, isn't it? I don't need to tell you that we must not keep the Sarevok waiting! I trust you didn't have any trouble in there? He said that the monks fell for the ruse and that <CHARNAME> was locked up, so he took the surface route out of the keep instead of meeting you in the crypts. We really must get moving if we are to catch up with him!~
@10993 = ~Terribly sorry, but I'm not who you think I am. I am <CHARNAME>, and I don't appreciate being the butt of a conspiracy.~
@10994 = ~Er... yes. Prat... that's me all right. What was the point of us waiting in the crypts, again?~
@10995 = ~Well, you certainly seem like SOME sort of prat, if not the precise one I was looking for. I might have expected more guile from Sarevok's supposed most threatening enemy. Why he thinks you could stop his take-over of Baldur's Gate, I have no idea. Do you mind if I don't stay to fight? I've rather more important things to be doing. We've a war to concoct, you know.~
@10996 = ~Yeah, I'm Prat. Prat is indeed my name. Where are we supposed to meet up with this Sarevok?~
@10997 = ~Prat is my name. This Sarevok person, who is he again?~
@10998 = ~The point? Did Sarevok not tell you? I suppose he might not have; he does have a tendency to only give information on a need-to-know basis. It hardly matters now, though. The monks of the keep are firmly of the belief that <CHARNAME> murdered the Iron Throne leaders with no provocation. <CHARNAME> has been locked away, and by the time they are sent to Baldur's Gate for trial Sarevok will have full control of the city. <CHARNAME>'s fate will be his to decide. You and your band were not needed to guard the boss's escape route after all. Everything went as planned. Shall we go now?~
@10999 = ~Back at the Iron Throne base in Baldur's Gate, of course. He has business elsewhere in the city, but no doubt we shall get our bit of coin if we await him there. There is still much left to be done, so I doubt he'll show for a while though. The disgrace of <CHARNAME> will make the road smoother, but we must still act fast. Sarevok is notoriously impatient. Let's get moving.~
@11000 = ~Who is...? Did he identify himself to you while in his monk disguise? Koveras will be whom you met then. Not a terribly original alias to be sure, but who is going to tell him that? Sarevok is quite used to getting his own way, and I gather subtlety is something that doesn't quite come naturally to him. He doesn't have the patience for it, though his mind is amazingly tactical. Certainly this made him perfect for organizing the Iron Throne's mercenary forces, though I doubt his superiors would say so now, what with his plot to have them killed. Such is the trouble with hiring highly motivated people. As underlings we can safely serve, but woe to those in a position he desires. We should get going.~
@11001 = ~Where exactly are we supposed to meet up with this Sarevok?~
@11002 = ~This Sarevok person, who is he supposed to be again?~
@11003 = ~You really shouldn't be telling me this. I am not who you think I am. I was the target of your scheme.~
@11004 = ~You will not be going anywhere! You conspired against me, and so you shall die!~
@11005 = ~I take it that you are not Prat then, are you? Rather an embarrassing mistake on my part, but no matter. The murder of the Iron Throne leaders was the primary goal; incapacitating you was to be a bit of happy circumstance. Oh well, must dash. You'll pardon me if I don't stay to roughhouse. Cheers.~
@11006 = ~Where exactly are we supposed to meet up with this Sarevok?~
@11007 = ~Sorry, but what was the point of our waiting in the crypts?~

@11015 = ~Right then. Off we go to meet with Sarevok. Don't want have him attacking us like Rieltar and the others.~
@11016 = ~That... that was never the plan. Sarevok wouldn't sully his hands on those he didn't deem worthy of personally killing. For <CHARNAME> and party to be blamed they were either to be imitated by doppelgangers or fooled into attacking Rieltar and the others unprovoked. You should know this. You... you're not Prat are you? Oh, bloody hell. Bit of a mistake on my part, wasn't it? Ah well, most of it went according to plan regardless. You'll forgive me if I don't stay for fisticuffs. Cheers.~

Does this disturb you? It should not; monsters are often closer to us than we like to think. You are siblings, and the paths open to him are yours as well, though he has been racing down his from his earliest days. You had Gorion to guide you, did you not? Sarevok had no one. He draws his strength from his hatred, from the thought of rising above those he knows to be inferior. His divine blood hungers for conquest, and that is why he must be defeated, but not killed.

You have felt the hunger and heard the offerings of power? Sarevok thinks they are true and so he seeks a senseless war, and a slaughter of a scale so grand as to defy description.

I do not believe he will survive his plan, it is all based on conjecture at best. He feels that he has been chosen, and that he will become... more than he is. I do not share this belief.

Duke Eltan may be saved, but Duke Entar Silvershield has been killed outright. The murderers have acted with anonymity, but I know who and where they are. You must go to the Undercellar; return if you have already been. There you will find Slythe and Krystin, two unsavory beings that revel in the violence Sarevok allows them to commit. They are no more than animals in human guise, even by the standards of the company they keep. Kill them and you shall know much of the plan.

Why, in my day we could weather month-long storms with nothing but a log or two, the skins of a few unfortunate bears, and the warm company of those we held dear. Of course, in those days trees were bigger, you understand? A good stout log could fire the hearth for a tenday, though you'd have to empty out the stables for a place to keep them dry.

Of course Vella had her father's axe too, and that made her an imposing sight at the forefront. She was tall as a pine and could deliver a backhand like you were so much silt on the breeze. I remember a time when she and Chester (this was Chester Allendale, no relation to the Blackboots and a good thing too; them Blackboots had not patience for Vella and her shenanigans...) Well, Chester and Vella were spelunking in the Ulcaster (at least, that's what the kids called it in those days) and her father comes up and by golly, Vella up and belts Chester so hard he didn't hit the ground for a week. Vella's father sees this and laughs so hard he plumb forgets he's mad. He's like that though, and the day he passes up a good joke will be the day he passes on entirely. I remember a time...~

He spilled the beans and revealed that it was Sarevok's plan to have me accused of the murders of the Iron Throne leaders, whether I could be goaded into the act or not. Doppelgangers were to impersonate me and ensure I would be blamed. With my party wanted by the law and Brunos and the others dead, Sarevok thinks he stands unopposed. He has returned to Baldur's Gate and plans to take control of the city somehow, likely using his leverage as the new head of the Iron Throne, so I should probably check their base out again. His end goal seems to be war with Amn, but his reasons are still not clear to me.~
@11661 = ~I found Winski Perorate near the entrance to the Undercity. Apparently he was Sarevok's mentor, but he was cast aside because he dared to rescue Sarevok instead of killing the Grand Dukes as he was supposed to. Winski said he knew I would follow, because Sarevok and I are of the same blood; blood that is also divine. War with Amn was not Sarevok's true goal after all. It was the slaughter of the initial battles that he wished. He thought death on the appropriate scale would cause him to ascend, and he would assume the portfolio of the slain Bhaal. Perhaps he would have, but who can really say? If you have the arrogance of a god and can kill like a god, who's to say you are not a god? I must stop this before he flees to try his scheme anew. There is a temple in the Undercity where Sarevok waits to make his last stand against me. He will not be alone.~

She would try to reclaim Sarevok the man, once Sarevok the would-be god is destroyed. In exchange for this she has confirmed my suspicions of Slythe and Kristen, the underlings of Sarevok that killed Duke Entar Silvershield, and indicated that they can be found at their base in the Undercellar. She has also directed me towards someone named Cythandria in the Iron throne base (who seems to be more her rival than mine). Tamoko has also given me much to think about. Sarevok and I are of the same blood; a god's blood. Sarevok thinks he was created to assume the mantle of the dead lord of murder Bhaal, ascending to godhood by causing slaughter on a god-like scale. Tamoko doubts such a thing can happen, claiming that a dead god would not create such children to effect his replacement, rather his resurrection. She seems to think that Sarevok's death will serve Bhaal more than a grand sacrifice in his name. Sarevok has made his beliefs known, but what am I to take from this? What will eventually become of me?~

@11880 = ~Apparently the ghost of Ulcaster himself haunts the ruins of his doomed school. I don't know what he seeks exactly, but he did mention that simply returning a few tomes would restore some hope to him. His words seemed to suggest that there are books in the rubble below. I will keep an eye out for them.~
@11881 = ~...knowledge returns with these simple words on parchment... to teach once more... in a celestial class... I will prevent the same from happening... some day...~
@11882 = ~I retrieved a book from the ruins of the Ulcaster School, and it seemed to restore some clarity to the specter of Ulcaster himself. He still haunts this place, but he is perhaps a little closer to letting go.~
@11883 = ~I encountered a wandering bard that spewed forth the most painful poem I have ever encountered. Some tripe about knights in a dungeon and a missing thief.~
@11884 = ~I encountered a bard near the Firewine Bridge ruins that told a rousing tale of a group of swordsmen. The song was not too clear on the details, but I gather one of the swordsmen's number betrayed them, and their spirits will not rest until they are reunited with the traitor. Such a fanciful tale.~

@11888 = ~Hey there, you're new here, aren't you? Could I trouble you a moment?~
@11889 = ~Yeah, I think you'll do fine. I need someone to go club some heads for me. I was ambushed by a band o' hobgoblins within sight of this Inn's walls. Robbed me blind, they did, and I want to return the favor. I don't care about most of my things, but I want to get my ring back. My father gave it to me, you understand?~

@11897 = ~Such manners! Well, I need a gruff hand for this task, so keep your "please and thank you" garbage for the nobles. I was robbed blind by some hobgoblins within sight of this very Inn's walls, and I need you to return the favor. They took my ring, and that's all I want back. Will you do it?~

@11904 = ~I am to return a ring to Joia in the Friendly Arm Inn. It is a flamedance ring, and was stolen by some hobgoblins just north of the inn.~
@11905 = ~Hmm? Nothing. I have no gold to give you. I was just robbed, remember? You'll be doing it out of the goodness of your heart.~

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: caster
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). It is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.~
@12141 = ~Burning Hands (Alteration)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: 1/2
When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from his fingertips. His hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: the wizard's thumbs must touch each other and fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of five-foot length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 hit points of damage, plus 2 points for each level of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3 + 20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. spell receive half damage.~
@12142 = ~Mirror Image (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 6-foot radius
Saving Throw: None
When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images seem to shift from round to round, so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard.~
@12143 = ~Shadow Door (Illusion/Phantasm)
Level: 5
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality he has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell duration. A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, or similar magical means can discover the wizard.~
@12144 = ~-Removed-~
@12145 = ~Dispel Magic (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
A dispel magic removes the magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the caster is lower level, then the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.~
@12146 = ~Minor Globe of Invulnerability
(Abjuration)
Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the minor globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and some effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the minor globe. Fourth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful Dispel Magic spell.~
@12147 = ~Non-Detection (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 20 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature or item
Saving Throw: None
By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature or object touched undetectable by divination and detect spells such as invisibility purge. It also prevents location by magical items. It does not affect the know alignment spell.~
@12148 = ~Protection from Evil (Abjuration)
Level: 1
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and second any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~
@12149 = ~Protection from Normal Missiles
(Abjuration)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
By means of this spell, the wizard bestows total invulnerability to non-magical hurled and projected missiles such as arrows, axes, bolts, javelins, small stones. Note, however, that this spell does not convey any protection from such magical attacks as fireballs, lightning bolts, magic missiles, or magical missiles such as arrows +1.~
@12150 = ~Protection from Petrification
(Abjuration)
Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Target
Saving Throw: None
This spell grants the recipient immunity to all petrification attacks. This includes basilisk and medusa gaze, cursed scrolls of petrification, etc.~
@12151 = ~Resist fear
(Abjuration)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Special
The wizard instills courage in the spell recipients, raising their morale to its highest. The recipients morale will gradually reset to normal as the duration runs out. If the recipients are effected by magical fear, they will regain their composure.~
@12152 = ~Flame Arrow (Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell enables the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage, plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. spell. The caster receives one bolt for every five experience levels (two bolts at 10th level, three at 15th level, etc.). Bolts must be used on creatures within 20 yards of each other and in front of the wizard.~
@12153 = ~Ghost Armor
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were field plate armor (AC 2). It is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.~
@12154 = ~Grease (Conjuration)
Level: 1
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30' x 30' square area
Saving Throw: Special
A grease spell covers a material surface with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. spell or slip and skid, unable to move quickly. Those who successfully save can reach the nearest non-greased surface by the end of the round. Those who remain in the area are allowed a saving throw each round until they escape the area.~
@12155 = ~Melf's Acid Arrow (Conjuration)
Level: 2
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 target
Saving Throw: Special
By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical arrow that speeds to its target unerringly. The arrow has no attack or damage bonus, but it inflicts 2d4 points of acid damage. (There is no splash damage.) For every three levels that the caster has achieved, the acid lasts for another round, unless somehow dispelled, inflicting another 2d4 points of damage each round. So at 3rd-5th level, the acid lasts two rounds, at 6th-8th level, the acid lasts for three rounds, etc.~
@12156 = ~Monster Summoning I
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 3
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 12 minutes (1 minute)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Within one round of casting this spell, the wizard magically conjures 8 HD worth of monsters. These appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents, until the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain.~
@12157 = ~Monster Summoning II
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 4
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 12 minutes (1 minute)
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is much like the 3rd-level monster summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 12 HD of monsters. These appear anywhere within the spell range and attack the caster's opponents, until the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain.~
@12158 = ~Monster Summoning III
(Conjuration/Summoning)
Level: 5
Range: 40 yards
Duration: 12 minutes (1 minute)
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell is much like the 3rd-level monster summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 16 HD of monsters. These appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents, until the spell duration expires, or the monsters are slain.~
@12159 = ~Clairvoyance (Divination)
Level: 3
Range: Special
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
The Clairvoyance spell empowers the wizard to see in his mind the geographical features and buildings of the region he is currently exploring. It extends to a great range, but cannot reveal creatures or their movements. This spell does not function indoors or underground.~
@12160 = ~Detect Evil (Divination)
Level: 2
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: sight
Saving Throw: None
This spell discovers emanations of evil from any creature. Any evil creature within the range of the spell will glow red briefly.~
@12161 = ~Identify (Divination)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is memorized, go to the history page of an unidentified item and press the Identify button. The chance of identifying the item is 100%. The spell identifies the item's name, what it does, and if it is cursed.~
@12162 = ~Infravision (Divination)
Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 10 turns
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of this spell gains the ability to see with infravision, just as an elf or dwarf would.~
@12163 = ~Detect Invisibility (Divination)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yards/level
Duration: 4 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
When the wizard casts a detect invisibility spell, he is able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addition, it enables the wizard to detect hidden or concealed creatures (e.g., thieves in shadows, halflings in underbrush, and so on). It does not reveal the method of concealment or invisibility, except in the case of astral travelers (where the silver cord can be seen). It does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects. Note: if an invisible creature enters the area of effect after the spell has already been cast, then the creature will remain invisible.~
@12164 = ~Know Alignment (Divination)
Level: 2
Range: 10 yards
Duration: instant
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
A know alignment spell enables the mage to exactly read the aura of a creature. If the creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. When a character is hit by this spell, he will glow red if he's evil, blue if he's good, and white if he's neutral.~
@12165 = ~Charm Person (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 1
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 17 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect.
If the spell recipient fails his saving throw (of which he receives a +3 modifier), he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.
'If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.
'If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.
Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he was charmed.~

Duration: 1d4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: caster
Saving Throw: Special
A friends spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 6 points of Charisma. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with the spellcaster and make an effort to be his friends and help him, as appropriate to the situation.

Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not.
'The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
'Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
This spell causes a 2-foot-diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly to its target. The effect the orb has upon the target varies with the level of the mage who cast the spell. A first-level sphere inflicts 1-4 damage and blinds the target for one round. A second-level sphere inflicts 1-6 damage and inflicts pain upon the victim. A third-level sphere deals 1-8 damage and burns the victim. A fourth-level sphere deals 1-10 damage and blinds the target for 10 rounds. A fifth-level sphere deals 1-12 damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.

Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.~
@12176 = ~Cone of Cold (Evocation)

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2
When this spell is cast, it causes a cone-shaped area of extreme cold, originating at the wizard's hand and extending outward in a cone five feet long and one foot in diameter per level of the caster. It drains heat and causes 1d4 + 1 points of damage per level of experience of the wizard. For example, a 10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold 10 feet in diameter and 50 feet long, causing 10d4 + 10 points of damage.~
@12177 = ~Fireball (Evocation)
Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2
A fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it: 1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points his finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their saving throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of caster

Level: 3
Range: 40 yards + 10 yards/level
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2
Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the spellcaster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g., if a 40-foot bolt was started at 180 feet from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 feet (180 + 40). If the lightning bolt intersects with a wall it will bounce until it reaches its full length.~

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
Use of the magic missile spell, one of the most popular first-level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4 + 1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile: he has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, etc., up to a total of five missiles at 9th level.~

Level: 2
Range: 30 yards
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time:2
Area of Effect: 30-foot radius
Saving Throw: Special
When a stinking cloud is cast, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 30 yards away from his position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful saving throw vs. poison or be reeling and unable to attack because of nausea, for 1d4 + 1 rounds after leaving the cloud. Those who make successful saving throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. These poisonous effects can be slowed or neutralized by appropriate magic.~

Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: caster

@12184 = ~Web (Evocation)
Level: 2
Range: 5 yards/level
Duration: 2 turns/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
A web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The web spell covers a maximum area of about 30 feet in radius (roughly the same size as a fireball). Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers.
Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a saving throw vs. spell with a -2 penalty. If the saving throw is successful, then the creature is free to move out of the area. A failed saving throw means the creature is stuck in the webs unable to move. Each round that a creature remains in the web, he must make a saving throw or be unable to move.~

Level: 5
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters: skeletons, usually from the bones of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster, regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature) entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat, 8 hours pass, or are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled. The wizard can animate one skeleton for each experience level he has attained.~

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Target creature

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 40' cube, 1 creature/level
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, each affected creature functions at double its normal movement and attack rates. A hasted creature gains a -2 initiative bonus. Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not sped up. All affected by haste must be in the designated area of effect. Note that this spell negates the effects of a slow spell. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic.~
@12194 = ~Knock (Alteration)

Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1

Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Touched creature
Saving Throw: None
When the wizard touches a creature while this spell is in effect, an electrical charge will deal 1-10 damage to the creature. The wizard only has one charge, and once an opponent has been touched the spell's energies have been used. If the mage misses, then the spell is wasted.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 3

Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: Person touched

@12198 = ~Vocalize (Alteration)
Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One spell-casting creature
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of this spell can cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise, so long as the casting takes place entirely within the duration of the vocalize spell. Only the verbal requirement of spells is deleted. This spell has no effect on other noises or speech; it simply removes a spell's verbal component.
This spell is of great use when quiet is desired in spell-casting or the individual has been magically silenced.~
@12199 = ~Dispel Magic (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 30-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
A dispel magic removes the magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is higher level than the creator of the effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the caster is lower level, then the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.
Note: while this spell dispels the effects of grease, web and stinking cloud, it does not dispel the area of effect.~
@12200 = ~Glyph of Warding
(Abjuration, Evocation)
Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent until discharged
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box.
Any creature violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores. A successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded.
When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When the glyph is activated, it deals 1-4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster to the victim.~

When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and second any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~
@12202 = ~Protection from Fire (Abjuration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Elemental (Fire)
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The effect of a protection from fire spell differs according to the recipient of the magic—either the caster or some other creature. In either case, the spell lasts no longer than one turn per caster level. When the spell is cast it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and to exposure to magical fires such as spells such as burning hands, fireball, fire seeds, flame strike, etc., absorbing 80% of all the damage dealt by such magical sources.~

Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more.~
@12204 = ~Remove fear (Abjuration)

Sphere: Charm
Range: 10 yards

@12206 = ~Sanctuary (Abjuration)
Level: 1
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When the priest casts a sanctuary spell, it causes all of his opponents to ignore his existence; as if he is invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to bless himself. He cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.~
@12207 = ~Shillelagh (Alteration)

Sphere: Combat, Plant
Range: Touch

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 40' radius

By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. A creature that rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell avoids entanglement. All creatures have a +3 bonus to their saves. An entangled creature can still attack.~

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection, Plant
Range: Touch
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When a priest casts the barkskin spell upon a creature, its skin becomes as tough as bark, increasing its base Armor Class to AC 6, plus 1 AC for every four levels of the priest: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor Class 4 at 8th, and so on. In addition, saving throw rolls vs. all attack forms except magic gain a +1 bonus. This spell can be placed on the caster or on any other creature he touches.~
@12210 = ~Resist Fire/Resist Cold (Alteration)
Level: 2
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is placed upon a creature by a priest, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat and cold. Complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note) is gained. The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flaming swords, fireballs, burning hands, or wands of frost. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by fire or cold reduced by 50%.~

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-foot-radius sphere
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast. Each creature in the area must make a saving throw vs. spell at -5; if the save is failed then they are silenced for the duration of the spell. Note that this spell does not continue to affect the area after being cast; only those in the area at the time of the casting are affected by the silence.~
@12212 = ~Call lightning (Alteration)
Level: 3
Sphere: Weather
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 1 turn
Area of Effect: 360-foot radius
Saving Throw: 1/2
When a call lightning spell is cast, it must be cast outside, otherwise it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down bolts of lightning. The caster can call down one bolt per turn. The spell has a duration of one turn per caster level. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points for each of the caster's experience levels. Thus, a 4th-level caster calls down a 6d8 bolt (2d8 + 4d8).
The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies. The caster does not choose the targets of the spell, though the lighting will not strike any of his allies.~

Level: 1
Sphere: All
Range: 60 yards
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 50-foot cube
Saving Throw: None
Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures and any saving throw rolls they make against fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack dice rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds

@12220 = ~Find Traps (Divination)
Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps, whether concealed normally or magically, of magical or mechanical nature become apparent. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus traps include glyphs, and similar spells or devices. Due to the nature of the spell, the caster must stop to concentrate once per round which will effectively interrupt any action. This however will not affect spellcasting.~
@12221 = ~Invisibility purge (Divination)
Level: 3
Sphere: Divination
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: instant
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 30 foot radius

@12222 = ~Know Alignment (Divination)
Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: 10 yards
Duration: 1 turn
Casting time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
A know alignment spell enables the priest to exactly read the aura of a creature. The caster must remain stationary and concentrate on the subject for a full round. If the creature rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. Certain magical devices negate the power of the know alignment spell.~
@12223 = ~Charm Person or Mammal
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Sphere: Animal
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 20 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a saving throw vs. spell to avoid the effect (with a +3 modifier).
'If the spell recipient fails his saving throw, he regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.
'If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken.
'If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed.
Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he was charmed.~

Level: 3
Sphere: Animal
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: target, and anyone within 5 feet.
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
This spell holds animals rigidly immobile and in place. Only normal and giant sized animals are affected by this spell. Monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs and carrion crawlers do not count as animals.
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell.
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@12315 = ~Hold Person (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 2
Sphere: Charm
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: target, and anyone within 5 feet.
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
This spell holds a single human, demihuman, or humanoid creature rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of mansize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre could not.
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@12316 = ~Miscast Magic (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 3
Sphere: Chaos
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: One target
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
Any spellcasting creature that is affected by this spell has its casting ability severely disabled. When the creature attempts to cast a spell it has an 80% chance of failure. Creatures can save vs. spell to avoid the affect, but do so at -2.~
@12317 = ~Magical Stone (Enchantment)
Level: 1
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By using this spell, the priest can create a small magical pebble, which then flies out and hits a target opponent. The stone deals 1-4 damage to whomever it hits. The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus.~
@12318 = ~Flame Blade (Evocation)
Level: 2
Sphere: Elemental (Fire)
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 3' long, sword-like blade
Saving Throw: None
With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from his hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar. If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 + 4 points of damage, with a damage bonus of +2 (i.e., 7-10 points) if the creature is undead or is especially vulnerable to fire. If the creature is protected from fire, the damage inflicted is reduced by 2 (i.e., 1d4 + 2 points). Fire dwellers and those using fire as an innate attack form suffer no damage from the spell. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures (other than undead) struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it. This spell does not function underwater.~
@12319 = ~Flame Strike (Evocation)
Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: Instantaneous
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Target creature
Saving Throw: 1/2
When the priest calls down a flame strike spell, a vertical column of fire roars downward in the exact location called for by the caster. The target must roll a saving throw vs. spell. Failure means the creature sustains 8d8 points of damage; otherwise, the damage is halved.~
@12320 = ~Draw Upon Holy Might (Invocation)
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 10 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None
The priest calls upon his god to grant him power for a short period. When he does this his strength, constitution and dexterity all are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster. A third level caster would have his abilities raised by 1, while a 12th level caster would have all his abilities raised by 4.~
@12321 = ~Spiritual Hammer (Invocation)
Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Self
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
By calling upon his deity, the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer. The priest for the duration of the spell may use the magic weapon. It strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4 + 1 vs. opponents of human size or smaller, 1d4 upon larger opponents, plus the magical bonus).~
@12322 = ~Aid (Necromancy, Conjuration)
Level: 2
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a bless spell (+ 1 to attack rolls and saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they cannot be regained by curative magic. Example: A 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6), and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit points, 3 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 4 normal hit points and all 3 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.~
@12323 = ~Cure Light Wounds (Necromancy)
Level: 1
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When casting this spell and laying his hand upon a creature, the priest causes 1-8 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.
'Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal, or can be cured, just as any normal injury.~
@12324 = ~Slow Poison (Necromancy)
Level: 2
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual it greatly slows the effects of venom, actually neutralizing all but the most deadly poisons.~
@12325 = ~Cure Serious Wounds (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
This spell is a more potent version of the cure light wounds spell. When laying his hand upon a creature, the priest heals 17 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body. This healing cannot affect noncorporeal, nonliving, or extraplanar creatures.~
@12326 = ~Raise Dead (Necromancy)
Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Sight of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Special
When the priest casts a raise dead spell, he can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, elf or human. Note that the body of the person must be whole, or otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life. The person has but 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.~
@12327 = ~Goodberry (Alteration, Evocation)
Level: 2
Sphere: Plant
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None
Casting a Goodberry spell creates 5 magical berries that the caster can carry with him. These berries cure one point of physical damage for each one eaten.~

@12630 = ~We thought it would be exciting, causing a little mischief amidst Umberlee's underlings, only it wasn't that much fun when we were caught. We both ran. I got away; Casson didn't. They... they killed him as we sought to escape.~
@12631 = ~Brilla~
@12632 = ~I realize that our meeting didn't go exceptionally well, but please reconsider. If you were to deliver Casson's body here within the ten days, I am sure the original offer would still stand. I implore you, there is no other solution for him or us.~
@12633 = ~Please pay Tremain no mind, we have risked much only to have failed. Though our deal was not completed, and you not paid, we respect that you tried nonetheless. I shall spread the word among the clergy that you are to be extended every hospitality. As much as Tremain has tried to keep this private, a number of his brethren know and sympathize with his plight. They will look kindly on you if needs be. Goodbye.~
@12634 = ~I've your payment here. Tsk, it will be some time before Casson and I get a night out again. It is good to have him back among the living, though I take some small pleasure in the trouble he's in for what we did. You'll notice I've not sat down since you've known me. Sometimes "Our Lady Who Smiles" downright laughs out loud. Look to us if you need aid in the future. Many a Tymoran will look favorably on you now. Good day.~

@12645 = ~There is nothing I can do, but I must do something. It's a risk, and risk is everything.~
@12646 = ~Varci! Who have you brought here?! I told you I must be alone with my thoughts!~
@12647 = ~You'll tell me later how you know in what alleys to learn such things. For now however, you are correct. We are in need of assistance and none in the clergy must know. Greetings to you all. I am Lord Priest Tremain Belde'ar, a humble servant of Our Smiling Lady Tymora. My request of you is an odd and very dangerous one. I will not hold you to it if you deem it too extreme. I would have you enter the Water-Queen's House, and retrieve my son's body. He and Varci sought to indulge their restless nature by sneaking about the place, and a high price was paid.~
@12648 = ~A harsh sentence for a simple prank, but trespassing on holy ground, whatever the faith, is not a small crime. You must bring his body to me, that I might restore his life to him. If you can retrieve him, I will reward you whether I am able to revive him or not. What say you?~
@12649 = ~An astute question. High Priest Chanthalas has deemed that Casson knowingly took a risk, and luck determined his fate. Since Tymora be the Lady of Luck, it is that fate we are officially to abide by. I, however, disagree. While Casson did dare and fail, I see no reason that I should not take the risk to rescue him. It makes no sense to me for Tymora to grant her servants resurrection powers, if to use them would anger her or interfere with the "fate" of another. So now I find I must move against the wishes of my church, but not the spirit of it. To me, it seems that they are more concerned about incurring the wrath of the Umberlants, than in following the spirit of adventure. You may anger her clergy by helping me, but I believe Tymora will smile on all of us.~
@12650 = ~My position in the temple does not allow for the stockpiling of great wealth, but many an adventurer before you have made tidings in exchange for our blessing. I can offer a meager amount of gold, but will better that with a magical item gifted me by one of said groups. I hope this will suffice?~
@12651 = ~I'll not compound my worries by taking out of the temple coffers! It is an affront to even suggest such a thing! Had we required mercenary thinking, we'd have hired mercenaries! Varci, escort these misers out!~
@12652 = ~Your decision is painful, but reasonable from a certain perspective. I apologize for taking up your time. Varci, escort our guests to the door.~
@12653 = ~There is hope for my son yet. I cannot tell you where in the Umberlant Temple Casson would be kept, but I would advise you to be careful. They seem a right unfriendly group, but once you get to know them they seem out-and-out heartless. Please hurry!~
@12654 = ~No success as yet, I see. It is imperative that you bring the body of my son within the next few days, or his resurrection will be beyond my ability.~
@12655 = ~Your efforts are appreciated, fruitless thought they were. The limit of my power has been exceeded with the passing of time, and death has firmly grasped my son's fate. I would be alone now, Varci will see you to the door.~
@12656 = ~By all the gods, The Lady Who Smiles must be positively beaming this day! Quickly, get the body inside where I prithee Tymora will grant it life anew. I'll not waste another moment until my son's soul is on solid ground once more. Come with, and see the wonder.~
@12657 = ~Now the moment I have yearned for. Please all, no noise. I must concentrate.~
@12658 = ~Blessed be Our Smiling Lady! He lives! Son, can you hear me?~
@12659 = ~Oh, my dear dear boy... you are IN SUCH TROUBLE! What in all the planes were you thinking child?! Gallivanting through an Umberlant Temple like that?! So help me, if turning you over my knee wouldn't kill you outright, you'd jump black to go right to blue!~
@12660 = ~Oh, no you don't! If you want to play the odds, you had best be sure you take responsibility for yourself! The Goddess of Luck and Adventure does not endorse DUMB luck or foolish risks! I swear, if your mother were alive to hear about this she'd drop dead where she stood, and THEN I'd have to raise her TOO! Do you have any idea what this spell takes out of a person?!~
@12661 = ~Not another word past your lips, young man! Your off to your room and see if I let you out before you're four score and twenty! March!~
@12662 = ~You are a man of some import. Why do you not organize your own temple brethren to aid you?~
@12663 = ~I would know what payment I can expect. I'll not take this task with out knowing what it is worth.~

@13136 = ~History of Amn:

Amn has the good fortune to have abundant natural resources; some would say Amn is the richest land on the continent. This has worked in Amn's favor for generations, because even if they were conquered, the new masters would be gentle, looking to gain wealth from the land, rather than to put it to the torch.

Amn has been a center of trade and commerce for as long as anyone can remember. Oral traditions handed down from father to son tend to support the theory that Amn has been a trade center for at least 800 years. Unfortunately, written records are difficult to find and often incomplete. It would seem the typical Amnian citizen was too busy trying to fill their coffers to write down events of the day.

Amn has always been more interested in the present and the future than the past, and this makes an accurate history difficult. The best records, the business papers of the oldest trading companies, are jealously guarded. The fear of revealing "trade secrets" is stronger than the call of history, so the average citizen knows very little about Amn's past.

It appears that the Amn of 100 years ago was very much like the Calimshan of today. Each major city was basically an independent entity, banding together for defense when necessary, and fighting for control of territory and profitable trade routes the rest of the time. A particularly brutal trade war began twenty-four years ago, with each city exacting prohibitive tariffs on goods imported from the others. The trade war escalated, and city troops began to raid caravans sponsored by other cities. In a matter of months commerce was brought to a halt, a number of cities were under siege, and war threatened to engulf the entire region.

Into the breach stepped a young merchant named Thayze Selemchant. Thayze was smart, charismatic, and very well connected (the Selemchant trading house was one of the oldest and richest in Athkatla). He secretly contacted representatives of the five other richest merchant houses in Amn, and started to plan.

The first part of the plan involved the careful sprinkling of rumors about outside threats. One involved a pirate invasion from the Nelanther, another was about a massing of orcs just on the other side of the Cloud Peaks. Thayze even started a rumor about an elf army in the Forest of Tethir, ready to pounce on a divided Amn. None of the rumors were true, but they began to turn people's thoughts toward unity, not war.

Thayze knew that if he and the other members of his council were to take control of Amn, they would need broad-based popular support. Tensions between cities and merchant houses were still high, so to get that support, Selemchant and the others agreed to drop their family names and never use them again.

When news of a "Council of Six" spread throughout the land, many people accepted their rule. A group that would unite Amn under one rule, governing for the benefit of all instead of one city or trading company over another, was indeed a welcome change. The Council raised an army (at great personal expense) to quell the few pockets of resistance that remained, and have been in total control of Amn for the past twenty-two years.~
@13137 = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire. Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there. Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places—Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr—took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change. As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born. It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calimshite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the Forgotten Realms. Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn. The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim. A force that great, they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the Realms, and that didn't happen. Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land. There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its power over its own area. About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land. Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do. The oldest son of each Pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one. The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over eighteen years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan forty-four years ago.~
@13138 = ~History of Cormyr:

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line.

The land has been officially at peace for many years—since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east. One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy." In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.~
@13139 = ~History of Dambrath:

The nation of Dambrath was formed out of a barbarian kingdom almost a half-millennium ago by a powerful alliance of priestesses of Loviatar and the drow from the city of T'lindhet.

In 211 DR, fleeing from the destruction of the homeland by the then-great kingdoms of Unther and Muhlorand, four tribes of barbarians entered Dambrath. They found a coast where the dolphins danced and plains where the grass was long. They roamed from the borders of the Walls of Halruaa as far east as the current borders of Estagund. They soon became known as the Arkaiun, or "people of the wind."

In 545 DR a great warchief, Reinhar, arose to lead the tribes. The halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved, and several of the coastal cities of Durpar were captured or razed. Estagund fell to his rule, and eventually Reinhar turned his attention to Halruaa.

An army of 40,000 horsemen and a fleet of 50 ships mounted a coordinated attack, and even though Reinhar was able to get beyond the Walls of Halruaa and occupy the cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalsuu, their magics proved to be more than a match for the invaders. Reinhar was finally defeated in a great battle at Sulaziir by the archmage Mycontil and his troop of wizards.

Reinhar's son, Reinhar II, took command of the army and set out on a two month overland retreat. He arrived home with a thousand surviving fighting men and no shaman. Reinhar II proved to be as good a ruler in defeat as his father was in war. He consolidated his forces and pulled home almost all of his troops, as he knew that the defeat made them tempting prey for raiders and encroaching monsters. This action allowed for the safe development of his peoples.

By the time the ninth Reinhar was king in 802 DR, the Arkaiuns were fat and lazy. Reinhar IX, or Reinhar the Foolish as he is more commonly known, insisted on expanding his nation to gain more gold to finance his military campaigns. He ordered the mining of many rich lodes of silver and electrum in the Gnollwatch mountains, but before his plans of expansion could begin, the miners encountered the drow of T'lindher. The drow were outraged and began a steady series of raids and attacks on the Arkaiun strongholds. Whole villages were destroyed overnight, and no trace of the invaders could be found.

Reinhar IX committed the foolhardy action of attacking the drow in retaliation. While the Arkaiuns managed to get a force into the drow city, this action only succeeded in uniting the normally chaotic drow. For once, the full power of a drow city was turned against an enemy.

The battle quickly moved back to the surface. Reinhar's raiders were wiped out, leaving Reinhar with only a small portion of his original military. This was not enough for the drow, who demanded total enslavement of the entire surface nation. The Arkaiuns resisted valiantly, and the war went on for three decades at tremendous cost in life to both sides.

Finally, the drow had the Arkaiun forces cornered at Malduir. Almost without hope, the defenders were overjoyed when a group of half-elven pilgrims appeared on the scene. The high priestess, Cathtyr Shintar, offered the aid of her clerics to help defend the city, and Reinhar took this to be an omen from the gods. A priestess was placed with almost every company.

Within a tenday the drow struck. The priestesses did indeed prove to be of great aid, but to the drow. Every priestess turned on the Arkaiuns, and Cathtyr herself slew Reinhar. The drow were still weakened by the battle, and only the presence of the priestesses enabled them to win. Cathtyr, realizing the unique advantage she possessed, made a deal that even the suspicious drow embraced. Her priestesses would rule the land, and in exchange they would provide access to the surface for the drow, trading weapons, slaves, and supplies.

The drow were delighted with this brazen offer from a surface dweller. Reinhar had been slain and the insult avenged, and after thirty years of war the drow were not particularly interested in Dambrath. They did insist, however, on taking the best captured males as slaves. Cathtyr quickly agreed to this, seeing the males as an obstacle to her own power.

Cathtyr ruled for 205 years. She fulfilled her promise to make Dambrath, or "The Nation of Pain," a bastion of evil in the Realms. In her time, Cathtyr saw the priesthood of Loviatar expand to thousands, and faith in the Beastlords previously worshiped by the Arkaiuns was nearly eradicated. Many of the Arkaiuns were able to escape their new mistresses and flee to the Swagdar. There they resumed their almost forgotten nomadic life.

The priestesses of Loviatar continued to enjoy good relations with the drow, and some even took mates, creating a race of drow half-elves. These dark half-elves became known as the Crintri, or "noble ones." Most are priestesses of Loviatar, though many are mages as well. They consolidated their power, learning much of the area from the Shebali, or "lower ones," as the Arkaiuns are now called. The capital of Dambrath was established at Cathtyr, built after Cathtyr's passing and named in her honor. Her death came at the hands of her daughter, Filina, who had grown tired of waiting for her mother to die. Filina ruled for only five years, however, before her own daughter, Cathakay, assumed the throne in the same fashion. Cathakay ruled for fifty-four years, eventually falling in battle against a gold dragon. She died childless, and her niece Melanith assumed the throne.

Melanith faced an increasing population, and unrest among males who longed for a return to their prestige of old. Melanith did not return their previous status, but she did make use of them. Fearing that the great nations of Mulhorand and Unther might rise again, she decided that mundane tasks, such as the defense of the kingdom, would be handled by men. She was the first to name a male to the post of warchief. Sadalar, a Crintri, became the queen's consort. His term as warchief was characterized by widespread bribery and corruption. He was, however, responsible for getting many privileges returned to the Arkaiuns. After Melanith's rule, the Shebali were considered second-class citizens, rather than slaves.

Though males were granted more power during her rule, Melanith also solidified the split between the sexes. While the rulers of Dambarth had been females for over two centuries, it was more because of competence than gender. Melanith, however, decreed that men could have no authority except over other men. The female-led hierarchy of Loviatar was quick to back this move.

Many of the bravest and best men of the kingdom perished in raids on Estagund, Durpar, the bandit tribes of Veldorn, and against the gnolls that had returned to the Gnollwatch mountains. Some even fought at the side of the drow in their battle with the svirfneblin city of Aventine. The deep gnomes were destroyed, but so were the Shebali. The drow and the Crintri were largely unharmed, and for their aid, the Crintri were rewarded with a number of drow males to breed in to their race. Melanith took a drow male as her consort to replace Sadalar, who had perished in the conflict. The drow, Nym Inthigg, fathered three daughters and a son. It was at this time that Melanith began the isolationist policy that Dambrath still follows today.

Melanith ruled for 156 years; her daughter Ausitil for 125. The current queen of Dambrath is Yenandra; she is known there as the "Pirate Queen," for she has sailed as far south as Zakhara on pillaging raids. Yenandra has been ruling for seventy-one years, and is beginning to show signs of age. She has three daughters as well, named Luatharyn, Meltruil, and Hasafir. While she does remain extremely popular, especially to the Crintri, the children of leaders in this land are not known to patiently wait their turn.

@13140 = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history. Over 3,000 years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin. When Raurin fell in 2488 DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia. Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged. Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy: All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the Realms were merely parts of the same entity. Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life. Merchants were honored above all. In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants. During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the Council of Merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries. War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement. During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed. Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath. The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every ablebodied fighting man they sent. The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts. He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time. He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things. He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade. He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems. He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life. Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range. They roamed as far east as Kara Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa. At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zaakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~
@13141 = ~History of Estagund:

Estagund history follows a different path than those of Durpar and Var. The Gunders were conquered in 551 DR by Reinhar I, warchief of the Arkaiuns of Dambrath. Estagund regained its independence when Reinhar was slain by the Halruaan archmage Mycontil, though the country soon degenerated into a group of small independent city states.

Skirmishes with Var, and between the city-states, continued for several centuries until a king once again united the country. King Bornial was a skilled ruler, and under him Estagund began to prosper. His descendants did not share his wisdom, and in 1053 DR, King Selkarin more than illustrated this. He had failed to conquer Durpar, and Veldorn resisted his challenges. An avowed misogynist, Selkarin turned his attentions to the matriarchy of Dambrath. He led a large fleet to attack Dambrath, taking extreme losses, including his own life. Selkarin died childless, so his brother Seltarir was crowned King. The new ruler faced a country with most of its fighting men gone, and an unforeseen problem: famine. The famine was caused by a blight that wiped out nearly all the year's crops in Estagund. This made him eager for a deal posed by the Durparian merchant Jeradeem, and in a legendary trade the entire country of Estagund was sold. Contrary to popular rumor, Seltarir did not trade away the country for 24 pearls. In actuality he received diamonds worth almost a million gold pieces. The sudden wealth gave him an instant seat on the Council of Merchants, so he retained a measure of rule in addition to his fortune. Chaka Seltarir is still the richest chaka in Estagund to this day. In the years that followed, the Gunders began rebuilding their lives under their new circumstance, and now they compete on equal footing with the merchants of Durpar and Var.~
@13142 = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King:

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire. This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel. It was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains; south and west of Wyvernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar; and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes.

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade. He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales -all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne.

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days. The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed. His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone. One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone. King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade.

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend. Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere. When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns.

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence. His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes. Caravan guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, "else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne." Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self professed neutral alignment. If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule. Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state. Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.~
@13143 = ~History of Halruaa:

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert. The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netheril, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe. It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow. The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times. Once, led by a magic resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa. They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader. Forty-thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by 500 Halruaans. More than 200 Halruaan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle.

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than 100 years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power hungry king of Lapaliiya. He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruaans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships. The attackers were easily routed.

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netheril didn't approve of. The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa.

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruaans very defensive, warlike and traditional. The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.~
@13144 = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings:

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the Realms. Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago.

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation. Throughout the centuries the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn. In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature. A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer and greatest competitor. Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion. The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Estagund. The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.~
@13145 = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding. However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves who feared the loss of their entire wood. This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR). This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today). It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands. Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them. Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace," and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads. At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches. The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court. There, he asked the elders of their Council to approve a road, open to humans, linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown). Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur. The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement. However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate. If the road was built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished. The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree. The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves. Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt). Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms. Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared. None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~
@13146 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshall of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshal of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; however, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~
@13147 = ~History of Shadowdale - Ashaba Becomes First Lord of Shadowdale:

Upon taking the Twisted Tower and removing the drowish yoke from the people, the Dalesmen had fully established the Dale of Shadowdale, with its seat of power in the tower itself. Its first lord was a water wizard who had aided in the final attack; Ashaba, who was great in age when he ascended, and ruled peacefully for forty years thereafter. It is said that Ashaba realized he was dying and turned himself to water, merging with the river. Since that time, the river, the ford, and the Twisted Tower all bear his name. Before passing on, Ashaba chose one of his trusted lieutenants as the new lord of Shadowdale. Presented to the people of the Dale, he was made the new lord by acclamation. In an additional honor, the pendant worn by Ashaba was thereafter recognized as a symbol of the lordship in the Dalelands, and was possessed by each of the successive lords following.~
@13148 = ~History of Shadowdale - Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre:

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale. All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home. A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs. During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll. Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale. The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune. Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.~
@13149 = ~History of Shadowdale - Aumry Rules in Peace:

The longest period of peaceful rule was by Lord Aumry and his wife Sylune (better known as the Witch of Shadowdale). They ruled over the community for forty years, a period of extended peace with their neighboring dales, nations, and the elven peoples. It was this very peace and power which made the Dale the target for attacks and sabotage by the Black Network (Zhentarim). They sought (and still seek) to control the trade from the Moonsea to the Sword coast, and desired to make Shadowdale a vassal state of Zhentil Keep. Lord Aumry's rule ended tragically when he was assassinated by Zhentish agents.~
@13150 = ~History of Shadowdale - Jyordhan the False Lord:

Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse.

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, Lord Aumry's widow, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.~
@13151 = ~History of Shadowdale - Khelben Kills Jyordhan:

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~
@13152 = ~History of Shadowdale - Lords Accepted by Acclamation:

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff. Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large. This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well. They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster). The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.~
@13153 = ~History of Shadowdale - The Time of No Lords:

During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (widow of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~
@13154 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale:

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well.

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there was little validity to the claim.~
@13155 = ~History of Shadowdale - Elminster Moves to Shadowdale:

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area. A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement. The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes. The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.~
@13156 = ~History of Shadowdale - Doust Chooses Mourngrym Amcathra to Succeed Him:

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years. "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra. Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers. Time has proven this choice a wise one.~
@13157 = ~History of Shadowdale - Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry:

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon. The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale). Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym. The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale. Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule. This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.~
@13158 = ~History of Shadowdale - Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped. The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender. Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan. While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR). When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle. In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters.

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old. By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community. Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his maturity, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name. If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.~
@13159 = ~History of Tethyr:

For the past 1,500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power. When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne. As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne. Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so).

The established re-occurring cycle was broken ten years ago. The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr. King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr. Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well. Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies. Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury. These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change.

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however, it takes treachery as well. In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and an impatient royal heir. Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army. While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile. By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help.

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates. At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father. A fire set by the elite troops would destroy evidence of treachery; the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government.

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point. Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire. At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid.

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family. Once Castle Tethyr began to fall, there was no holding back the mob. In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin. Everything of value—fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.—was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust.

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos. In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword. This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding."

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell. Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived. These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr.

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted. "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society. The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~
@13160 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was a great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command of the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races. However, these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep—its slender, now-broken spires—can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~
@13161 = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra:

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known. One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess' other actions during that period, is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate. The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen. This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission. It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals. Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.)

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable. One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun. Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted. Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate. Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved. To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives.

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Dornal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter. Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to. Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body. Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Dornal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor.

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter. Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Er'sseae Qilue. These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters.

Dornal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; he had always wanted sons as well as daughters. More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell—in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her.

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power. To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body.

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme. Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess. He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North. Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final thirty years of his life. When Dornal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant. Now known as the Watcher, Dornal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.~
@13162 = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea. Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago. In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara. This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba. These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia). In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar. It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted. According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves. As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods. People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others. Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center. These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Daleland's territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands. They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations. Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base. This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales. A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale. During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep. More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~
@13163 = ~History of the Dead Three: 'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE'

In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well. Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal wielded. The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the Realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually the trio destroyed one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves.

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest: the Bone Throne.

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant. "I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. "And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer.

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, "The Throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position." Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued: "Who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened. "After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal.

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed. Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened. "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him.

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.~
@13164 = ~History of the Dragon Coast:

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin. Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day.

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall. It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south. And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power.

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate. The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords. His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast—corruption and treachery.

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR. Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated.~
@13165 = ~History of the Drow, The Descent:

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "elves of the south," before this crucial event. Even then they were known as "dark elves," for the hue of their skins. They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South. A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes. Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them.

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered. This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~
@13166 = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars:

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during the Descent. In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark. They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items, and using them against the dwarves, establishing an enmity that is still strong today.

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm. This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden. The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities. The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as the Great Rift. The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize, and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell. "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.~
@13167 = ~History of the Fateful Coin:

Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life. When each new-born baby enters into the Realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche. Beshaba calls it in the air—the moon (heads) or the cloak (tails). If Beshaba is right, that person is cursed with misfortune for the rest of his or her days. If she's wrong, Lady Luck smiles on that child for the rest of his or her life. For some rare beings, the coin lands edge on—and these luckless few can forge their own fates, for they have more freedom over their destinies than the powers themselves.~
@13168 = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerun, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion. The powers then dropped a star onto the land. The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars. Slowly picking up speed, the ball rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks. The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths. The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemminglike, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future. They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~
@13169 = ~History of the Moonsea:

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes. The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar.

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North—including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands—who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic. In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region.

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning. Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants. Phlan has fallen and risen again. Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town. Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks. Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt.

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea. The greatest cities—Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep—are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips. The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature. In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality.~
@13170 = ~History of the North - The First Flowering:

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining). From their ornate forest cities they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races. Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union. The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore. Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves. To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races.~
@13171 = ~History of the North - The Crown Wars:

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast. They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands. Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins. Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud. It enshrouded the kingdom of Mieyritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived—nor were trees left; only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor.

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day). They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants. Astonishingly, in at least three places—the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor—they succeeded with shining grace.

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder—a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over 3,000 years Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.~
@13172 = ~History of the North - Recent History of the North:

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows.

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel—and they'd told the king that he'd be disposed by other orcs.

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, as Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival."

For four months, the forty thousand orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls—never too good to begin with—created losses of their own.

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn.

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the superhuman prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould.

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness.

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.~
@13173 = ~History of the North - The Elven Exodus:

This era left behind elven strongholds ripe for pillaging by humans and orcs. When elves chose to leave the North and travel to Evermeet, their works quickly disappeared, leaving only places like the Old Road and a ruined port in the High Forest to mark Eaerlann's passing. And yet it was not only the elves who would disappear from their long-held homes; the human nation of Netheril also stood on the brink of history.

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fill its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began 3,000 years ago and reached its conclusion 1,500 years later.

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has there been such an outpouring of orcs. Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught, and with the aid of the treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more.

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.~
@13174 = ~History of the North - The Spread of Humankind:

The adaptable humans made use of magic they could seize or learn from the Proud Peoples to defeat all enemies, breaking (for a time) the power of giants and orcs. Waterdeep was founded. The last of the pure blood elves died out, a result of continued marriages with humans.

In the far west, men also dwelled—wise, clever primitives called the Ice Hunters. They lived simple lives on the coast since time beyond reckoning, countless generations before Netheril's first founders set foot on the Narrow Sea's western shore. Yet this peaceful folk fell prey to another invasion from the south: crude longships that carried a tall, fair-haired, warlike race who displaced the Ice Hunters from their ancestral lands.

This race, known as the Northmen, spread farms and villages along the coast from the banks of the Winding Water to the gorges of the Mirar. Northmen warriors drove the simple Ice Hunters farther and farther north, forced the goblinkin back into their mountain haunts, and instigated the last Council of Illefarn. Within 500 years of the Northmen's arrival, Illefarn was no more—its residents had migrated to Evermeet.

From the Coast, Northmen sailed westward, claiming and establishing colonies on the major western islands of Ruathym and Gundarlun, eventually spreading to all the islands in the northern sea. Others migrated northward, past the Spine of the World, and became the truly savage barbarians of Icewind Dale.

In the centuries that followed, Ascalhom became Hellgate Keep when it fell into the hands of fiends, and Eaerlann collapsed under the attack of a new orc horde. The elves fled southeast, joining with Northmen, Netherese descendants, and dwarves to form what would later be known as the Fallen Kingdom. This realm was short-lived and collapsed under the next orcish invasion—though in dying, it dealt the goblin races a blow from which they have yet to recover.~
@13175 = ~History of the North - The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost—until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city—this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerun. With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns, the seas swim with Northmen pirates, and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor—and support—pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and—most importantly—replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying 17 wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~
@13176 = ~History of the North - 1368, Year of the Banner:

As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe. As the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible—as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem—to safety.

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included both heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale.

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail.

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog.

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city.~
@13177 = ~History of the North - 1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarfriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extra-planar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than 100 tanar'ri and other fiends as well as 500 members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extra-planar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission. Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than 100 miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest—including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists—battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell alongside his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed—and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Tumstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the Realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland." While it's unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around 20 fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home.~
@13178 = ~History of the North - Return of the Beast (1367 - ?):

Sages, philosophers, historians, and priests alike feel an ill-boding in the chill air. They predict a slow change over the next decade, but within the lifetime of men born on the first day of this age. They believe that the beasts that once ruled the land plan to return to claim what's rightfully theirs, imprisoning and enslaving the crowns. Where elves once reigned, men now rule, but their hold—as true for all civilizations before—is tenuous at best.~
@13179 = ~History of the North - 1370, Year of the Tankard:

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man.

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, quick to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.~
@13180 = ~History of the Red Ravens:

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Red Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract. They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north. They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade. They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they do not wish to jeopardize their royal charter. Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords. They charge 200 gp per week for the services of their 110-being unit. Their symbol is a red raven amulet.~
@13181 = ~History of the Sisters of Light and Darkness:

This was the birth of the world and the heavens. After Lord Ao created Realmspace, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows before light and dark were separate entities. Within this dim chaos stalked 13 lords of shadow, the Shadevari—whether they came form elsewhere or are children of the shadow itself, none can say.

Eventually this primordial essence coalesced into twin beautiful goddesses who were yin and yang to each other; they were so close they thought of themselves as one being. The Two-Faced Goddess created the heavenly bodies of the crystal sphere and together infused them with life to form the Earthmother, Chauntea. (Although Chauntea has since contracted her essence to encompass only Abeir-Toril, in the beginning she embodied all matter in Realmspace.) This new universe was lit by the face of the silver-haired goddess, who called herself Selune, and darkened by the welcoming tresses of the raven-haired goddess, Shar, but no heat or fire existed within it.

Chauntea begged for warmth so that she could nurture life and living creatures upon the planets that were her body and limbs, and the two sisters-Who-Were-One become divided, as for the first time they were of two minds. Silvery Selune contested with her dark sister over whether or not to bring further life to the worlds. During this great conflagration, the gods of war, disease, murder, and death, among others, were created from residues of the deific battle. At one point during the battle, Selune seized the advantage and reached across time and space to a land of eternal fire. Fighting the pain of the blaze, which burned her sorely, she broke off a fragment of that ever-living flame and ignited one of the heavenly bodies so that it burned in the sky and warmed Chauntea.

Incensed, Shar redoubled her attack on her injured twin and began to snuff out all light and heat throughout the crystal sphere. Again Selune gave of herself and tore the divine essence of magic from her body, flinging it desperately at her sister in defense of life in the sphere. This essence entered Shar, ripped an equal portion of energy from her, and reformed behind her as the goddess of magic, known now as Mystra, but then as Mystryl. Though Mystryl was composed of both light and dark magic, she favored her first mother Selune initially, allowing the silver goddess to win an uneasy truce with her more powerful, dark twin. Consumed by bitterness at her defeat, Shar vowed eternal revenge.

The twin goddesses contested for eons as life struggled into existence on Toril and the other planets under Chauntea's watchful gaze. Shar remained powerful, but bitterly alone, while Selune waxed and waned in power, often drawing strength from her allied Daughters and sons and like-minded immigrant deities. Over time, Shar grew strong again, aided by the shadevari who preferred night to blinding light and who stalked the Realms seeking to meld light and dark into shadowy chaos once again. Shar's plot to reform the world after her own desires was undone when Azuth, the High One, formerly the greatest of all mortal spellcasters and now consort to Mystra (incarnate successor to Mystryl), found a way to imprison the shadevari in a pocket-sized crystal sphere located beyond the edges of the world by creating the illusion of a realm of shadows. The Lords of Shadow were drawn to investigate, and before they discovered the trick, Azuth imprisoned the shadevari with the Shadowstar, a key of shadows forged by Gond. The High Lord then hurled the key into the endless reaches of the cosmos allowing life to flourish on in Chauntea's loving hands.~
@13182 = ~History of the Unicorn Run:

Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life, and a cradle of fecundity. Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source, and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world. Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity. As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.~
@13183 = ~History of the Valley of the Gods:

It is said that even the powers must cavort and amuse themselves once in a great while. Far to the north of the Spine of the World is the Valley of the Gods. A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is not meant for mortals. Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley. Far too many mortals with delusions of grandeur have thrown away the pleasures of this side of the Spine and their kingdoms in this world, only to break their backs searching for the legendary Valley of the Gods.~
@13184 = ~History of the Vast:

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr.

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only forty years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The dwarves were overrun by the orcs, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast.

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth.~
@13185 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked—Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land—freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~
@13186 = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth:

Much confusion exists in the Realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim. The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood. In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled, independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea. It is one of the most evil cities in the Realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices. Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales. The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale.

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch). Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership. The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts. Their rulership has spread with the passing years. In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes. Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas.

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep. Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.~
@13187 = ~History of Ulgarth:

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power. When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism. Warchiefs united the country several times during this period. They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden. In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth. There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land. They settled down, and began raising children and crops. This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace. But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits. The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants. In 1002 DR, the centuries' long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power. There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other. With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations. Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world. In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth. Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade. The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.~
@13188 = ~History of Waterdeep:

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof) was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the Realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city.~
@13189 = ~History of Waterdeep - Age 0, Tuabemoots and Pioneers:

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing, hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs with vessels sailing in from the south for merchant's jewelry, metal tools, and the occasionally-available weapon or two. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademeets were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, or a rocky island beyond it.~
@13190 = ~History of Waterdeep - Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings. After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors. Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed.~
@13191 = ~History of Waterdeep - Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council. The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the people's consent. The Guildmasters, however, said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must have been golems or zombies, controlled by Ahghairon to conceal his lone rule—and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, oft-times termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two—ruthless manipulators both—were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~
@13192 = ~History of Waterdeep - Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins:

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage to be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few—in secret—to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished.

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next 200 years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords. Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the Realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money—and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith. Twice more the city walls were expanded, as Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity. Its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came.

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).~
@13193 = ~History of Waterdeep - Age lV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before—save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the Realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North.~

My friend since the h-h-head wound, he is the only miniature giant space hamster you are ever likely to meet. We have a bond, we do. Onward! Onward to adventure!~
@13946 = ~Pay him little mind. Minsc must make his "dejemma" by seeking adventure, while I must prove my worth to my... sisters in much the same manner. 'Tis an interesting time for the Realms, with great things foretold for the Sword Coast. Hopefully we shall all find what we seek.~

@14809 = ~Yeah, yeah. Lay off the short-guy jokes, they're older than your grandmother's uncle. The damn blade ain't worth nothing. It's a pride thing. I'll give ya 50 gp if ya wipe 'is arse with it.~
@14810 = ~Bah, the sword ain't worth the tin she's made from. I'll give ya 75 gp just to seal that yappin' mouth of 'is for good.~
@14811 = ~Why does everyone insist on picking on me!?!?~
@14812 = ~I feel so insecure. Nobody 'ere really likes me. They're always bullying me and pushing me around. My therapist says it's because I still 'ave some unresolved issues with my father. I just don't have the heart to tell her that 'e was killed in a bizarre fishing accident when I was only three. *sigh* I just wish people would stop picking on me, you know?~

@14828 = ~Well, Zhurlong is making progress in our ongoing joint therapy sessions. He has confessed his kleptomaniac tendencies and has even gone so far as to return the gold that he has stolen from me thus far. Most surprising, however, has been his offer of 100 gp above and beyond what was actually due. Sadly, he referred to it as a down payment on my pocket... Nevertheless, with time, I still hold out hope that he might be cured.~

@14871 = ~Harrumph! Here's your 100 gp and the 95 I owe you. The remaining 5 goes towards getting me a new chicken.~
@14872 = ~Heh! Better luck next time, folks. Better luck next time.~

@14879 = ~You're better fighters than I thought. Probably saved my life out there, much as I hate to admit it. Here, you'd better take my hunting bow as it seems to get me into more trouble than it's worth.~
@14880 = ~There's more than bears in this wood. No one knows what, exactly, but it's definitely more than bears.~

@14883 = ~Yes, we would gladly join you for a while.~

Keep whatever you don't use and I'll give you an extra 120 gp if you bring back my husband's old boots that he keeps down there. If you bring back one of their bodies and my ol' bottle of wine as well, I might toss in a little something extra too.~
@14907 = ~Ahh, me wine. Here's your 75 gp and thanks for clearing out the spiders on your way through. If you have any of my other possessions, come talk to me again.~
@14908 = ~Ahhh, I see you have the largest of those pesky spiders in my house. With this one dead, I'm sure the others will have run away. You are too kind to an old gnome like myself. Thank you so much. If you have any of my other possessions, come talk to me again.~
@14909 = ~Ah, I'm so glad I can move home again. Bentley is a kindly man but it is always best not to push favors too far. Here's 120 gp for your trouble. I'll just take those old boots from ye. If you have any of my other possessions, come talk to me again.~
@14910 = ~You have none of my possessions at the moment, so there is little reason for me to speak with you.~

And two of the greatest are Arkion and Nemphre, necromancers fighting over trinkets and baubles of little use or value. I assure you, they are more trouble than they are worth. You are better off steering clear of them.~
@15038 = ~Ah, fair adventurers. The roads of this fair city are lined with fools, are they not? Two of the greatest are Arkion and Nemphre, necromancers grown bitter over lost love. Alas, but they use petty trinkets as their excuse for enmity. Nemphre covets Arkion's bloodstone amulet and Arkion dreams of her onyx ring. Steal those trinkets and bring them to me and perhaps those two fools can at last find peace.~

@15040 = ~Ah, the bloodstone amulet of Arkion and Nemphre's onyx ring. I hope no blood was shed to get these for that may yet rest heavy on your conscience. Fools are to be suffered in this world, not slaughtered. Be what may, at least they may find some peace. As for these trinkets, you might as well sell them somewhere as they are of little use to anyone. For your troubles I will give you this cloak. It may be of some use to you in the future.~

@15163 = ~You've come here to fight ankhegs? Well, listen up: it's mating season, so it's primarily females coming up to the surface, looking to put on a little extra weight. They're hungry, they're aggressive, and there are a lot of them. Now, the point of this exercise is not to exterminate them, but to keep their population to a manageable level. Remember, they aerate the soil and thereby improve crop yields by as much as 15%. Food is going to be scarce enough in the next few years, so keep that in mind when you're out there. No more than ten ankhegs per party. After that it's catch and release, alright? Most of the activity starts about fifty yards to the east. Now move out, everyone. I'll keep an eye on things from here.~
@15164 = ~Good work, and I'll trust that you stuck to the quota. Here is 75 gp. Go find yourself a room in the city and rest up. You've earned it.~

@15172 = ~What a beautiful ring, where-e'er did you get it (most likely quite near where exactly I put it...) wertle, oh wertle, oh dear wertle-wooo... wertle, oh wertle, oh woo... Oh, I know what you're thinking of Mad Arcand the Stinking who takes what you give him and gives not in return. So, here, take this bottle but please don't unstopple or (wertle, poor wertle), you'll surely get burned.~

Being merchants, I don't think they're too concerned about honesty and integrity, though. If you've got a spell or potion that would bump up my intelligence or wisdom for the next little bit, I'd greatly appreciate it.~
@15178 = ~I hate tests...~
@15179 = ~Ooh, that does feel good. Thanks so much! Here's 50 gp. I'll let you know how it turns out.~
@15180 = ~What a weird test... The entire point of it was to get people to cheat like that. "Seize every possible advantage," the instructors said afterwards. When I told them you gave that to me for only 50 gp, they passed me with flying colors! ...Capitalism is so strange.~

@15185 = ~The hawks tell me that you cleared away the ogre-magi all by yourselves. I am impressed with your valor. Here, let me give you these fine gloves as a token of my appreciation. They are so supple that you can feel even the downiest feather as it brushes against your palm.~

@15187 = ~Pleasure to meet you. The name's Cordyr.~
@15188 = ~Hi. The name's Cordyr. I'm from down south, where the Cloud Peaks tumble into the sea. A pair of sirines has been trying to move into the area. They sank my fishing boat and put me right out of work. *sigh* If they weren't so dang beautiful, it would be a lot easier to convince people of how much of a nuisance they can be...~
@15189 = ~We didn't murder anyone, and we're not surrendering to the likes of you!~
@15190 = ~We didn't murder anyone, so we're perfectly willing to go to trial. Our innocence of this unwarranted accusation should be refuted quickly, within any fair court of law.~
@15191 = ~Don't do this young one. If you resist, we'll be forced to use lethal force.~

@15193 = ~Now that you put it that way... take us to your prison.~
@15194 = ~Halt and hold! You stand accused of murder most foul! You will lay down your arms and come with us, or by order of Angelo Dosan you will be killed where you stand! Such is his order and I cannot alter it! It is your choice!~

@15201 = ~Thanks for your help. It's a dirty deed but it's the cost of civilization, isn't it? Here, take this haste scroll as payment. I probably should have given it to you before, but I didn't think you would survive. Better late than never?~
@15202 = ~I'm no fighter, friend.~
@15203 = ~If you find a great deal on a fishing boat, let me know.~

@15206 = ~Is there no other option? Perhaps I could... enhance your wage?~
@15207 = ~Dreadfully sorry, but my duty transcends friendship. I must carry out Angelo's orders regardless of my personal feelings, though many of us do not trust him as we did Scar. Your sentence is likely trumped-up, but we must obey. He is our rightful leader after all.~

@15213 = ~That may be so, but Scar is dead and Angelo is his "proper" replacement. We in the ranks have no other choice but to obey his orders, suspect though they may be! You must decide: submit and face judgement or fight here and die. I have no choice, but you do!~

@15220 = ~Then I must carry out the sentence decreed by Angelo! You will pay for your crimes! There is no escape from the Flaming Fist!~
@15221 = ~No, your potions and magics are of little use. The only way to cure this sickness is to right the wrongs of the past. Behind a painting at the Three Old Kegs, you will find the skull of my brother, Kereph. Take it to Agnasia in the Lady's Hall. She will know what to do with it.~
@15222 = ~I— I am cured. After all these long years of rotting away, an end has come. Blessed be Tymora and may my brother at last have peace. You are kinder than you'll ever know.~

@15226 = ~...The skull of Kereph... He was a priest here long ago and Tymora blessed him greatly... too greatly, perhaps. Made some people jealous... made him some enemies... Then one night we found him dead, his body torn and broken, his head gone. No one ever found the killer. No one ever asked. It is best to leave that sort of justice to Tymora. Perhaps this is her forgiveness, no? ...Go well in the luck of Tymora, stranger. Find Ghorak, for he should now be cured of his affliction.~
@15227 = ~May Tymora curse you!~
@15228 = ~With breath that strong, you could kill giants. Now get out of here before I hurt you.~
@15229 = ~Hey you! You look either bored or foolish. Either way, I could use your services. Some wiseacre tried to send a basilisk by freight and now it's broken free and is making a mess of one of the warehouses at the harbor. As I said, I need someone who's either bored or foolish.~
@15230 = ~Look, how many times to I have to ask you? The docks are more ornamented than the high hall!~
@15231 = ~Thanks and long live the foolish! Here's 500 gp for taking care of that on such short notice. Also, you might want these. They're an item I obtained from a fence I know in Athkatla. You never know, they might fit you.~
@15232 = ~Thank the gods for bored adventurers. I don't know what we'd do without you. Here's 1,800 gp for your help.~
@15233 = ~Curses! You adventurers are all the same! I've got an emergency to deal with and all you want to do is cause trouble! Damn you to the ninth Hell!~

@15238 = ~That was kind of you to do that for me. As for Euric, he'll come home when he's ready. Here, let me give you this necklace as a token of my thanks. I don't know if it's worth anything but it has been in the family for years.~
@15239 = ~Hi there. I hope that the necklace I gave you was actually worth something. Otherwise I'd feel quite foolish.~
@15240 = ~Please don't!~
@15241 = ~That was kind of you to do that for me. As for Euric, he'll come home when he's ready. Here, let me give you this necklace as a token of my thanks. It is very powerful but one must be careful with it.~

@15274 = ~Ah, a ring of angel's skin. You must know my lady well to have chosen so appropriately... If you're ever needin' a little work around here, check with Scar, Second-in-Command of the Flamin' Fist. You can tell him I recommended you.~

They have already come under the eye of a powerful druid who goes by the name of Voltine.

@15386 = ~I'm afraid my stocks are not quite as full as they should be, but I do try to keep a good supply of the basics on hand.~
@15387 = ~I'm sure that will suffice. Let's have a look, shall we?~
@15388 = ~Perhaps I shall return when your shelves are not so lean.~
@15389 = ~My doors are always open to those with coin in their pockets. If I don't have what you need, then you don't really need it.~
@15390 = ~Show me what you have and I shall decide for myself.~
@15391 = ~Your slogan is tempting, but I am quite well stocked for now. Good day.~
@15392 = ~Hi, I'm Well-Adjusted Al, and my prices are sensible. I used to be called "Crazy Al," but therapy has convinced me that selling plate armor for 3 gp and a small duck was no way to get ahead in business.~
@15393 = ~Ooookay. Just show me what you have and I'll be on my way.~
@15394 = ~Thanks, but no thanks. Get your hand off my arm. I'll be going now. Good bye.~
@15395 = ~It is good to see someone with coins to spend, especially in these troubling times. No doubt you are part of an adventuring group? Who else would have wealth to spare when commerce is so slow?~
@15396 = ~The source of my good fortune is none of your concern. Just show me your goods and I shall be on my way.~
@15397 = ~Welcome to the Watchful Shield. Our devotion to He of the Unsleeping Eye is unswerving. Please, allow us to shield and protect you under the ceaseless gaze of Helm.~
@15398 = ~You are a bit too interested in my personal business for my liking. I shall go elsewhere for my shopping needs.~
@15399 = ~I'd like to see what services you have to provide.~
@15400 = ~Sorry, the thought of being watched by some kind of ceaseless eye disturbs me immensely. I'll find my own way out.~

@15422 = ~Sorry, but I do not want you back in the group just yet.~
@15423 = ~If that's the way you want it, then fine, I'll leave! -sniff-...~
@15424 = ~I don't wanna go, but if yer gonna force me, then I guess I'll just mope around here 'till you come back to your senses and come back for me.~

@15426 = ~We have fought well and we have fought bravely. Tempus willing, perhaps I will fight at your side again someday.~
@15427 = ~You've been good to me, friends. Bust some heads, will you?~
@15428 = ~Fine, I'll be leaving the likes of you, then. This party's been just another prison for me.~
@15429 = ~I'm sorry, but my wife and I would like some time alone; isn't that right lovey?~

@15431 = ~world~
@15432 = ~Ah well, even the best things pass away. Your company was enjoyable while it lasted. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@15433 = ~It is too hard to be stealthy with a group like this. I should have known not to have joined you in the first place.~
@15434 = ~You would have me leave the group? I agree to do so, but only as it serves my purposes for the time being. (I will wait here, but I am not a patient man.)~
@15435 = ~You would cast me out as though I were a servant? (They will all pay for their insolence!)~

@15442 = ~No doubt you have returned to your senses and wish to continue our glorious fight against evil! A wise and fortuitous decision.~
@15443 = ~As it should be! Let us go!~
@15444 = ~But... but... we were a team, we were bound by... by honor! -sigh-... Why is everything always so complicated?~
@15445 = ~Indeed, little one. Such fun we will have. Welcome back.~
@15446 = ~Oh goody good good! Let's go!~
@15447 = ~I don't wanna go, but if yer gonna force me, then I guess I'll just mope around here 'till you come back to your senses and come back for me.~
@15448 = ~By Tempus, you have returned! Are we to join again and fight as mighty warriors should? Say it is so!~
@15449 = ~That is a fine idea. We simply could not do without your fighting spirit.~
@15450 = ~I am sorry, but I do not need you back just yet.~
@15451 = ~A triumphant day, indeed! I welcome your company once again!~
@15452 = ~We have fought well and we have fought bravely. Tempus willing, perhaps I will fight at your side again someday.~
@15453 = ~It seems we have crossed paths yet again. Shall we renew our partnership and travel together?~
@15454 = ~Your company was missed by all. Welcome back to the group.~
@15455 = ~I've no need of your services quite yet. Perhaps in the future, but not now.~
@15456 = ~Ah, old friends made new again. A pairing that cannot be beaten.~
@15457 = ~Ah well, even the best things pass away. Your company was enjoyable while it lasted. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@15458 = ~So you've come back, have you? Perhaps we should join forces once again. There is much work left to be done.~
@15459 = ~That is an excellent idea. Your sage advice and company have been missed.~
@15460 = ~I have other plans for the moment. Perhaps another time.~
@15461 = ~A wise move. Together we can't possibly fail.~
@15462 = ~You've been good to me, friends. Bust some heads, will you?~
@15463 = ~It is about time you returned! If I had waited another moment you would surely have regretted it! Let's get moving!~
@15464 = ~That is a bit presumptuous of you. I have no desire to have you back just yet.~
@15465 = ~Though I do not enjoy your manner, I do have need of your talents. Welcome back.~
@15466 = ~Save your pleasantries. (I will suffer their company merely because they are useful.)~
@15467 = ~You would cast me aside yet again? Do not press me further! I will wait here, but do not tarry!~
@15468 = ~We meet again. I trust you have been vigilant in protecting the ways of nature? Perhaps we should continue our previous partnership, and further our causes together.~
@15469 = ~I have no need for your assistance at this time, though I may call upon you in the future.~
@15470 = ~Your suggestion is a good one. Welcome back, Faldorn.~

@15487 = ~Aye, so everyone's heard, everyone's a rubbernecker, then, is that it? Old Gurke had his famous cloak stolen right off his back by a batch of paltry tasloi. Yeah, yeah, it's old news and if you make one crack about the Cloakwood being an appropriate place to lose it, at least, I'll put your liver on the menu. Now move on and let the next people in line have their laugh.~
@15488 = ~Sure, bring your friends, bring your relatives. Damn it, I oughta start charging you fools for this gawkery!~
@15489 = ~My cloak? Hmph, I thought it was as good as gone. Here, let me give you 280 gp for returning it.~
@15490 = ~Put that thing away, you damned fool. I'm a bleeding tourist attraction around here, now. There's money in that! Losing this old cloak was the best thing that could have happened to me. No more hacking and slashing my way through life. Nah, I've got it easy now. Keep the damn cloak and good riddance.~

@15495 = ~So, have you tested your steel against those half-ogres I mentioned?~
@15496 = ~Fine work! News of the battle has reached me even here. In an effort to encourage such deeds of righteousness, allow me to present to you this shield... The Sword Coast needs more heroes of your sort, especially in times as dark as these.~
@15497 = ~How are my fine heroes? If only these wounds of mine were quicker to heal I would be lunging into the heat of battle at your side.~

I don't know if you're heading that way but, if you ever end up in Baldur's Gate, keep your eyes open for Gheldehar, an old gnomish cleric. Trickier than an old wyrm, that one. He's still got an old ring of mine which I'd love to have back, actually. Oh, and in case you didn't catch it... that was a subtle hint.~
@15509 = ~Thanks for the ale, sucker.~

@15776 = ~My party has been attacked by Phandalyn, an over-vigilant paladin loitering in one of Baldur's Gate's many seedy taverns. Mental note: when one depends on a party of evil, steer clear of muscle-bound paladins.~
@15777 = ~Upon attempting to cure Ghorak the Diseased in the slums of Baldur's Gate, he has asked a dark favor of me. Behind a painting at the Three Old Kegs lies the skull of his brother Kereph. I am to present it to Agnasia in the Lady's Hall, where perhaps I will learn more of this sorry tale.~

@15786 = ~Old Gervisse, who claims to be watching over a pair of young twins in Baldur's Gate, has asked me to seek out and kill a dangerous druid named Voltine. She is apparently polymorphing herself in an attempt to slip past Gervisse's nightly defenses and abduct the twins. There is something that still disturbs me about all of this but I'm not sure what...~
@15787 = ~In the midst of rather... unfortunate circumstances, I have learned from Voltine, a shape-changing druid, that this city suffers from an old Peeping Tom named Gervisse. As my encounter with Voltine got off to a bad start, it may be in my best interest to deal with Gervisse and thus return me to the druid's good graces.~

@15790 = ~It appears that I have wormed my way into some inter-farmer politics here in the fields just south of the River Chionthar. Old Jeb tells me that his neighbor, Old Man Hendrick, has fed some item of value to one of his chickens, lacking, I suppose, any better hiding place... The lure of this strange tale is admittedly a hard one to resist. If nothing else, I suspect I will at least nose around Hendrick's farm a bit as it lies just west of here.~
@15791 = ~Shaella, a most interesting priestess of Leira, has sent me on a pilgrimage home to Candlekeep, wherein lies the Great Book of the Unknowing. To read from its pages, nay even to touch this Greatest of Books, blesses one with the ignorance that only it can grant. I will speak with her again once I have found it.~
@15792 = ~The druid Olivia, in her seat by the sea, weaves her words as one would weave a spell. She yearns to be a gull, someday, and fly in their midst. It is a noble dream and, if I can grant it, I surely will, if for no other reason that to watch the beauty of her flight...~
@15793 = ~The druid Olivia, in her seat by the sea, weaves her words as one would weave a spell. There is a darkness to her, though, although she seems to have found her peace with it.

@15794 = ~Gurke, a crusty old dwarf in Beregost, has had his supposedly famous cloak stolen from him by a batch of tasloi in the Cloakwood. After our brief encounter, I have come to the conclusion that I'd do almost anything to rid him of that sour mood!~
@15795 = ~Bjornin, a paladin currently healing from his wounds in Beregost's Jovial Juggler Inn, has asked me to uproot a band of half-ogres. According to his report, they have been fortifying themselves in the mountains south-southwest of town.~

@15797 = ~I stumbled across a dirty little gnome called Gheldehar in an alleyway, today. He claims that Pilar, an old "friend" currently staying at the Friendly Arm Inn, has stolen his boots and he would like to have them returned. As Gheldehar didn't seem to care how I might acquire them, I suspect his use of the term "friend" was little more than window-dressing.~

@15800 = ~Over a frothy ale at the Friendly Arm Inn, Pilar the half-elf has warned me of Gheldehar, an old gnomish cleric in Baldur's Gate. He still has an old ring of hers and, if I could ever get it back to her, she has promised to make the journey worth my while.~
@15801 = ~I cannot write long as I am faced with a pressing emergency: Worgs have surrounded an abandoned lighthouse to the west and poor Ardrouine's son is trapped within. May Tymora bless the peasants of this land for their lives are never easy.~

@15803 = ~His sentences overwrought with emphatic hesitations, G'Axir the Seer has informed me that my future is hemmed in darkness. His predictions are less than surprising...

@15805 = ~His sentences overwrought with emphatic hesitations, G'Axir the Seer has informed me that I am a light entering darkness. His predictions are less than surprising...

@15807 = ~We'll you don't have to. I don't need you back yet.~

How the iron shortage or the trouble in the Nashkel mines could possibly be linked to you, you have no idea.~ [CHAPTER1]
@15837 = ~It is certain that the death of Mulahey will relieve the fears of the terrorized folk of Nashkel, but you remain uneasy. While the half-orc may indeed have caused the evils that befell the mine, the shortage of iron is too widespread to be his doing alone.

@15838 = ~Mulahey and Tazok have proven to be nothing more than puppets; the true master of this unfolding mystery continues to elude you.

@15859 = ~A debt you have, but I do not wish to collect at this time. Perhaps later.~
@15860 = ~I do have need of you, but not because of your debt. You skill is invaluable to me.~

@15879 = ~Nestled atop the cliffs that rise from the Sword Coast, the citadel of Candlekeep houses the finest and most comprehensive collection of writings on the face of Faerun. It is an imposing fortress, kept in strict isolation from the intrigues that occasionally plague the rest of the Forgotten Realms. It is secluded, highly regimented, and it is home.~ [INTRO01F]
@15880 = ~Within these hallowed halls of knowledge your story begins. You have spent most of your twenty years of life within this keep's austere walls, under the tutelage of the sage Gorion. Acting as your father, he has raised you on a thousand tales of heroes and monsters, lovers and infidels, battles and tragedies. However, one story was always left untold: that of your true heritage. You have been told that you are an orphan, but your past is largely unknown.~ [INTRO02F]
@15881 = ~Drawn to the clamor of the forge at an early age, you have become quite skilled working for the monks of the keep, and have kept them supplied with whatever tools are occasionally required. Inspired by your foster father's tales of ironclad heroes, however, you know you would much rather swing a blade than a smithy's hammer. One of the Watchers has been kind enough to take you under her wing, and has trained you in the basics of the deadly arts. You yearn to leave the safe walls of your library home and venture forth along the Trade Way, a trusty weapon at your side.~
@15882 = ~Inspired by your foster father's knowledge of the magical arts, you have made especially productive use of your library home. You have poured over the vast, if often inaccessible, treasury of magical lore, and learnt as much as you can. Gorion has been kind enough to instruct you in the basics, but he seems a touch overly concerned about your safety. You know, however, that experience could teach you so much more, and you yearn to travel as a journeyman mage.~
@15883 = ~Inspired by your foster father's colorful tales of rogues and scoundrels, you have spent your childhood yearning for intrigue. On the stage of your imagination, the ambling, preoccupied monks of the keep have often played the secret lords of Waterdeep, their purses ripe targets for your nimble fingers. On more than one occasion Gorion has asked you to very tactfully return a pen or an inkwell to the pocket from which it came. The more valuable of the keep's treasures remain impenetrable to your wiles, but you have little desire to steal from your benefactors anyway; you long for more appropriate and accessible pickings.	~
@15884 = ~Long have you marveled at the tales read to you by your foster father, many gathered from the various holy books on the shelves of Candlekeep. The strength and power of faith inspired you, but the petty squabbles of the gods only filled you with disdain. From this you came to understand the monks with whom you share your home, and the nature of their nondenominational beliefs. Joining in their studies you have come to think of yourself as one of the Avowed. Some of the brethren, perhaps responding to Gorion's subtle urging, have graciously fielded your many questions and taught you much about the meaning and role of the priesthood.~
@15885 = ~Set as they were against the sounds of the sea crashing against the rocks outside the keep, you have always been drawn to your foster father's tales of the unspoiled wilderness. You have occasionally found exotic flowers pressed and long forgotten between the pages of tomes, and often spent long hours studying Nature's varied forms in some of the library's many journals. It is your foremost wish that someday you will leave the sterile walls of Candlekeep, and worship the Earthmother in her own presence.~
@15886 = ~You have long been enraptured by your foster father's countless tales, though not so much for the content as for the art of the telling. Blessed by a world of books, you have surrounded yourself with the ancient legends and endless lore, and developed quite a skill for showmanship. One of the cooks has become quite fond of you and, between recitations of often bawdy poems and songs, has provided you with somewhat haphazard voice instruction. Gorion, in his kindness and wisdom, has been urging you to find another teacher before you ruin your voice for good.~
@15887 = ~Inspired by your foster father's tales of chivalry and honor, from a young age you committed yourself to the pursuit of good and the punishment of evil. Candlekeep is a world of many sacred and unspoken laws, and you have learned to uphold them all unquestionably. Your honesty and integrity have brought you to the attention of some of the keep's Great Readers, but as of yet none of them have had cause to call upon your services. While the citadel sees the passage of the occasional ne'er-do-well, its regimented atmosphere rarely needs to be purged of evil. The peace of your surroundings should be comforting, but instead you find it stifling. You know your true place is traveling the Realms, fighting evil wherever the need arises.~
@15888 = ~Inspired by your foster father's tales of adventure amidst the barrens, hills, and forests of Faerun, you have learned to appreciate the power and challenges of the wilderness. While you cannot remember ever venturing further than the outer walls of Candlekeep, you are a welcome and frequent visitor to its stables and pens. Much of your time is also spent atop the great towers of the citadel, where birds often seek shelter from both predators and the chill of the ocean winds. Still, you yearn to reach beyond, deep into the meadows and forests that you behold from your lofty perch.~
@15889 = ~Inspired by your foster father's loving tales, you have always dreamt of living the life of an adventurer, traveling the land by your wits and talents alone. The grounds of the keep were often the stage for many an imagined battle, much to the consternation of the monks that share your home. Companions your age being somewhat of a rarity, you endured by playing every role yourself, a habit that has stayed with you as you enter into adulthood. As Gorion used to advise you, "A little bit of everything makes a better soup."~
@15890 = ~You know little of how you came to be a ward of Gorion's, but over the years you have gleaned something of your mother's tale from his vague allusions and from the words he sometimes uttered in tear-filled sleep. She was a dwarf from Mithral Hall and a friend of his for many seasons. As you have no memory of her, nor any keepsakes to remind you of her existence, you have come to believe that she died while giving birth to you. Perhaps it was the pain of such a parting that led Gorion to cloister himself within the narrow halls of Candlekeep and raise you as his own. Of your father, you have learned nothing.~

@15953 = ~I was in one of the great spires of the keep last night, and saw the strangest sight. The horizon was aglow for a time, as though many a man carried torches in the distance. Usually there are only merchants on that path, though never at night. Bandits perhaps, but so many?~

@15959 = ~It would seem prices are on the rise across the land. Stores of iron are dwindling, and nearly every industry depends on it, in one way or another.~

@15961 = ~I don't know why supplies of iron ore are dwindling. Can't a simple increase in trade solve the crisis? Baldur's Gate is a major route between Waterdeep and Amn.

@15983 = ~Thanks, kiddo. Gorion didn't bring you up half bad, did he... You're lucky to have grown up here in Candlekeep, to be honest. Sometimes I think that the world outside these gates has gone mad, what with all this fighting over iron shortages and all.

@15984 = ~Don't make me beg, kid! Now get my sword before the Gatewarden has my hide!~
@15985 = ~Took your sweet time, didn't you? Gorion's a fool for trying to bring you up right and you can tell him I said so, too.

@15986 = ~You cannot further specialize in this proficiency.~
@15987 = ~Shh, kid. I'm on duty.~
@15988 = ~Carrion crawler
The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily upon carrion. When such food becomes scarce, however, it will attack and kill living creatures.
The crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm and a cephalopod. Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard.
The monster's head is covered with a tough hide, but the body of the carrion crawler is not well protected. The monster is accompanied by a rank, fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.~
@15989 = ~The shortage of iron has been gradually building for some time now. People have had plenty of opportunity to get paranoid. Not me though, no sir. Nope. Eh, could you stand a little back from me please?~
@15990 = ~Ettercap
Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders. These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps—very deadly traps—much like the spiders that often live around them.
Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick. Ettercap' heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth. The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth. Ettercaps do not have a formal language. They express themselves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, shrieks and violent actions.~
@15991 = ~Ghoul
Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cunning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.
Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls. The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the nails grow strong and sharp like claws.~
@15992 = ~There were stores of iron ore stockpiled to get us through lean times, but something is wrong with it. Anything smelted becomes brittle within days. It's like the metal is diseased somehow. It makes it impossible to keep weapons and armor in good repair.~
@15993 = ~Oh, hello! Hey, have you seen my copy of "The History of Halruaa" anywhere? You know how I can't stand the constant shuffling of arthritic feet up in the library... So I thought I'd get a bit of fresh air just east of here and... Oh, I hate being so absent-minded! Please, if you find it, I really do need it back.~
@15994 = ~Gibberling
They come screaming, jabbering, and howling out of the night. Dozens, maybe hundreds, of hunchbacked, naked humanoids swarm unceasingly forward. They have no thought of safety, subtlety, or strategy, leaving others with no hope of stopping their mass assault. And then, having come and killed, the gibberlings move on randomly back into the night.
The first impression of gibberlings is of a writhing mass of fur and flesh in the distant moonlit darkness. The pandemonium is actually a mass of pale, hunchbacked humanoids, with pointed canine ears, black manes surrounding their hideous, grinning faces. Their eyes are black, and shine with a maniacal gleam.~
@15995 = ~Gnoll
Gnolls are a large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands.
While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human. They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish-gray to dull yellow mane.~
@15996 = ~Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive.
The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing six feet tall. Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large male have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red. Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired. Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes.~
@15997 = ~Kobold
Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demi-human races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.
Barely clearing three feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water, and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobold fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.~
@15998 = ~Ogre
Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls. Adult ogres stand nine to ten feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color—or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish-blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well. It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is ninety years.~
@15999 = ~Skeleton
All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created as guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests.
Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which would allow movement. Instead, the bones are magically joined together during the casting of an Animate Dead spell. Skeletons have no eyes or internal organs.
Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demi-humans, animals of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids like bugbears and giants.~
@16000 = ~Giant spiders
Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground. Most are poisonous and bite prey first, because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.
Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs.
Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders.~

@16002 = ~Dear, absent-minded Phlydia has lost another of her books, "The History of Halruaa," this time. Last time she was at Candlekeep, she lost an entire four-volume set in the hay we keep for the cows.~

@16004 = ~My book! Oh, you remind me of Gorion when you grin like that. Raising you has been hard on him, I know, but he says it's a toil of love, a toil of destiny, even.

@16006 = ~Nice day, ain't it? Too bad Nessa, here, ain't enjoyin' it, though, her bein' sick 'n' all. I need to get her one of them potions of antidote off Hull.

@16007 = ~Nessa the Cow is feeling a bit under the weather today. Dreppin's asked me to get a potion of antidote from Hull, who's been posted to the gate this morning. It appears that Hull has been using them to avoid his morning hangovers...~

@16009 = ~Heh, yer a wonder, you are. Stick with me and we'll go far... Well, okay, stick with me and we'd prob'ly never leave the walls of Candlekeep, would we... They say the bandits out there aren't after gold and gems anymore but just plain old iron. It's one of them whatchamacallits, paradoxes or whatever: It's dangerous so you want to wear some good solid plate and carry an axe that'd make Tempus jealous but, rather than protectin' ya, it just makes everyone want a piece of you, right? Given my druthers, I guess I'd rather stay right here...~
@16010 = ~Heh, yer a wonder, you are. Stick with me and we'll go far... Well, okay, stick with me and we'd prob'ly never leave the walls of Candlekeep, would we... Hmm, good thing you ain't wearin' none of that metal armor, though, as I hear that the bandits out there would just as soon kill you as look at you to get it off your back. I just hope this whole iron crisis business is wrapped up soon.~
@16011 = ~Yup, Nessa sure liked that potion of Hull's. She's doin' better already.~
@16012 = ~Ugh, what a mead-filled night. That Hull is just too much. Poor sap had to go man the gate this morning, too. I don't know how he does it... What can I do for you, anyway?~
@16013 = ~Nothing, really. I was just nosing about.~
@16014 = ~Yeah, the mead would explain why Hull forgot to put his sword on, this morning. He sent me to fetch it for him.~
@16015 = ~Sure, sure. It should be in the chest over against the left wall, there.~
@16016 = ~Yeah, well, don't think this headache means I'm not keeping my eye on you.~
@16017 = ~I was just wondering if you had any errands I could run.~
@16018 = ~Errands? Yeah, actually. I need a quarrel of crossbow bolts. If you could get some off Winthrop at the Inn, I'll reimburse you... Oh, very well, there'll be a few coins in it for you too, so you can stop giving me that look.~
@16019 = ~Fuller's recovering from last night's mead-fest in the barracks. After a little pestering, he agreed to give me a little bit of change if I fetch a quarrel of crossbow bolts from the innkeeper, Winthrop.~
@16020 = ~What, no bolts? Why they let Gorion bring kids like you into this place, I'll never know.~
@16021 = ~Thanks, kid. I hear tell you might be leaving this place soon. Watch your back out there, okay? Here, let me give you this dagger. My father killed a hobgoblin with it once, many years ago. Stabbed him right in the back, he did. It ain't no broadsword, but it'll do in a pinch. Now take care of yourself.~

@16036 = ~The iron crisis has taken everybody off guard. Why plan for a shortage when the resource is nearly unlimited? I guess we're paying for it now. I guarantee that if we survive through this it will never happen again. People will be hoarding metal for months.~

@16039 = ~What with the raids on iron stores and the trouble in the mines it's a wonder we've any arms or armor left at all. It can't help but weaken the area, and I bet Amn is just waiting for our guard to go down.~

You should now move clockwise around Candlekeep. As you move around the keep you will find green robed monks. Talk to these monks and they will give you lessons on how to play the game. To talk with the monks left click on them while your character is selected. Your character should walk over and talk with the monk.

Also, many different messages will be given to you through the text window on the bottom of the screen. To expand and contract this window, simply use the two small buttons to the right of it.~ [TEXTPOP]
@16215 = ~If you have a mage, cleric, or druid in your party, your character must memorize spells using the Rest button on the Mage Book or Priest Scroll pages. To get to these pages, right-click on your character portrait and then select the book or scroll icon that appears on the left.~ [TEXTPOP]

@16218 = ~You can pause the game at any time by hitting the space bar or left-clicking on the clock face.

"Thieving" includes Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, and Remove Trap, when used in conjunction with the appropriate targets (chests, people, and traps, respectively). "Find Traps" examines a general area, and outlines found traps in red. "Stealth" renders a thief effectively invisible until their next attack. That attack is automatically a "backstab," increasing the damage of a successful hit dramatically.~ [TEXTPOP]
@16222 = ~Clerics or paladins have the ability to Turn Undead. Activating this icon will cause many undead creatures to flee or even be destroyed.

The weapon outlined in green is the current weapon. Attack with fists only (empty quick slot) if you only wish to knock your opponent unconscious. If you have a character with magical abilities, try casting a spell using their Spell icons.~ [TEXTPOP]

@16228 = ~Interaction defaults to Talk for neutral targets, and Attack for hostile targets. To talk to a neutral character (neutrals are identified by blue circles), left-click on one of them. Don't forget to select one of your party members to do the talking. If you would like to talk to a hostile character, select the Talk icon and then left-click on the character. If you would like to attack a neutral, select a weapon icon and then left-click on the target.~ [TEXTPOP]
@16229 = ~Wizards, Clerics, Druids, and Bards can all cast spells. Select their Cast Spell button, choose a spell, and left-click on your target. You can also configure Quick Spells by right-clicking on a Quick Spell slot. This summons a list of memorized spells to choose. If no spells are listed, the character either does not have any spells memorized or cannot cast until higher levels. To cast the quick spell, left-click on the appropriate quick spell slot and then select your target.~ [TEXTPOP]
@16230 = ~My friend Gorion,
Please forgive the abruptness with which I now write, but time is short and there is much to be done. What we have long feared may soon come to pass, though not in the manner foretold, and certainly not in the proper time frame. As we both know, forecasting these events has proved increasingly difficult, leaving little option other than a leap of faith. We have done what we can for those in thy care, but the time nears when we must step back and let matters take what course they will. We have, perhaps, been a touch too sheltering to this point.

Despite my desire to remain neutral in this matter, I could not, in good conscience, let events proceed without some measure of warning. The other side will move very soon, and I urge thee to leave Candlekeep this very night, if possible. The darkness may seem equally threatening, but a moving target is much harder to hit, regardless of how sparse the cover. A fighting chance is all that can be asked for at this point

Should anything go awry, do not hesitate to seek aid from travelers along the way. I do not need to remind thee that it is a dangerous land, even without our current concerns, and a party is stronger than an individual in all respects. Should additional assistance be required, I understand that Jaheira and Khalid are currently at the Friendly Arm Inn. They know little of what has passed, but they are ever thy friends and will no doubt help however they can.

Luck be with us all.

I'm getting too old for this.

@16281 = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.

@16282 = ~Mounted knights cannot effectively use long pole weapons while on horseback, and as a result, many weapons have been fitted with shorter shafts so they may be wielded with just one hand. Maces and flails are two previous examples of this—the war hammer is another. The horseman's war hammer is the descendent of the Lucerne hammer. It is made entirely of steel, with rondels protecting and strengthening the grip. Rondels are small disks of metal, often shaped into decorative designs. The shaft is about eighteen inches long.

When man mastered metals, spearheads were made from iron and steel. Having reached this end, weaponsmiths began experimenting with different types of spear heads, thus leading to the development of certain polearm types.

Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the longbow.

@16570 = ~Rumor from Volo: Many a story have I collected from across this great realm, though sometimes I am at a loss whether to believe them or not, due to their extraordinary circumstance. Such a tale is this, wherein lies the story of a band of hearty adventurers moving amidst the shadows of the land, effecting change where it is needed. I was enjoying the simple fare of the celebrations in Nashkel, when the strangest news hit the town. It would seem the mines, long plagued by unexplained deaths, had been inundated by a horde of ill mannered kobolds, under the direction of a rather unscrupulous and hygienically suspect cleric of Cyric. Dispatching the villain with appropriate brevity, the heroes freed the mine, and are the sole reason for the trickle of iron finally winding its way to the Gate now. None seem to recall their names, but the consensus agrees they were great of stature, and cut an impressive figure across the plains.~
@16571 = ~Rumor from Volo: Stranger tales I have told, but none are as fresh in my mind as this one, which is also fresh from the happening as well! It would seem that the orchestrators of the ever vexing iron shortage supplied themselves and their allies with ore mined from a secret location, and while the coast was in turmoil they built quite the power base at the aforementioned mine. A group of heroes, for they can only be called such, lay siege to the encampment and ultimately flooded out the evil conspirators in a rushing torrent of water and justice, though not before securing the release of some several dozen enslaved workers. A serious blow, I am sure, to whatever fiendish plot is brewing in our fair land.~
@16572 = ~Rumor from Volo: Stranger tales I have told, but none are as fresh in my mind as this one, which is also fresh from the happening as well! It would seem that the orchestrators of the ever vexing iron shortage supplied themselves and their allies with ore mined from a secret location, and while the coast was in turmoil they built quite the power base at the aforementioned mine. A mysterious group of battle-veteran strangers, for I hesitate to call them heroes, lay siege to the encampment and ultimately flooded out the evil conspirators in a rushing torrent of water and justice, though every slave to the man was lost in the drenching. 'Twould seem they didn't wish to encumber themselves, though I imagine the weight of those dead souls must be nigh unto horrific. The question to pose then, is whether the devil you know is better than the devil you don't. We shall wait and see what comes of this.~
@16573 = ~Rumor from Volo: Some tales defy all logic or explanation when posed to the sane mind, and it is a story just so that I give to you now. Much of it is already known, due to the celebrity of those involved, though many may find it truly shocking how deep the seeds of destruction were sown. Beloved Sarevok, a man among men, set to all but rule the coast, was actually a core architect of the very iron shortage that so unraveled the economy of the land, and had a hand in the poisoning of Duke Eltan that directly led to his rise to power. We were but seconds away from the first step down that path when from the shadows again stepped the unknown group of my previous tales. None can say definitively what happened next, though it is certain that Sarevok was pursued to the very bottom of the undercity, and from there he did not return. I'll wager many would just as soon have seen him chased to the ninth plane itself, as he hurt many of the folk of the land, both direct and indirect.~

You are fools even to be here, for we are indeed merchants, though not of wares you would be familiar with: We are merchants of faces and names, merchants of identities, merchants of skin even when the flesh it contains is so much rubbish. We are doppelgangers and, for a skin pittance, we sell fools their deaths.~

@16697 = ~You're no better than Ms. Silke! It will catch up with you, someday, mark my words.~
@16698 = ~Ah well, I suppose it will give me the opportunity to work on this new ballad I've been thinking of... I bet you'll never guess who the protagonists are!~
@16699 = ~As ye would have it. I likely would have put a dagger in ye eventually, but for now ye have been adequately useful.~
@16700 = ~As ye would have it. I likely would have put a dagger in ye eventually, but for now ye have been adequately useful. Come wizard, we are inseparable until the day ye die.~
@16701 = ~And good riddance to yer bad rubbish! I suggest ye sleep with one eye open from now on.~
@16702 = ~And good riddance to yer bad rubbish! I suggest ye sleep with one eye open from now on. Come wizard! I'll not miss yer inevitable death by leavin' ye behind!~
@16703 = ~I've no wish to strain our relationship, but you did promise to go to Nashkel. Our delay is making me rather... tense. I'm not nice when I'm tense.~
@16704 = ~Much as I truly care about your needs, I would prefer that we forgot your petty travels and went to Nashkel!~
@16705 = ~You said we would go to Nashkel! You did! I don't wanna be you friend no more! Wahhhhhh!~
@16706 = ~You... you're letting me go? But we have shared so much... so many good times... this is truly a sad day indeed. Goodbye, so sad, blah blah blah and all that rot.~
@16707 = ~Well, my good friends, perhaps you'd like to know a little more about me? I'm part of an order known as the Zhentarim. We've been sent to learn why the Zhentish name has been slandered along the Coast Way. It would seem that someone has been trying to make our order look bad.~
@16708 = ~You... you're letting me go? But we have shared so much... so many good times... this is truly a sad day indeed. Goodbye, so sad, blah blah blah and all that rot. Come along Montaron. You are my counterpart and we shall not be separated.~
@16709 = ~Indeed, it is quite about time that we should part company. You have proven unsympathetic to my interests, and I look forward to eventually owning a charming little ashtray made from your skull. Toodles.~
@16710 = ~Indeed, it is quite about time that we should part company. You have proven unsympathetic to my interests, and I look forward to eventually owning a charming little ashtray made from your skull. Come, Montaron. We shall not be separated by this fool.~
@16711 = ~Ooo... subtle, yet insulting.~
@16712 = ~Now you've gone and set him off! Blasted mage will blither for hours! Off wit ye! I'll not suffer the both of ye!~
@16713 = ~I'm already going to Nashkel. One of my current acquaintances wishes to visit there as well.~
@16714 = ~I'm already going to Nashkel. One of my current acquaintances wishes to visit there as well.~
@16715 = ~Indeed? Interesting. In that case I think we should definitely travel as one. You can never be too careful about the dangers of the open road. Wherever they may spring from.~
@16716 = ~We take too long! My charge is in desperate peril! If we do not go now you are a coward!~
@16717 = ~You agreed to help in my cause, yet now you break your word by your inaction! I'll have none of it! Feel the wrath of Minsc and Boo!~
@16718 = ~I have never seen such behavior in all my days! And you claim to be heroes? Raaaargh!!!~
@16719 = ~Boo and I were about to leave anyway! I have never seen such behavior in all my days! And you claim to be heroes? Good riddance! Come Dynaheir, I will not feel good about your safety until we are away from here.~
@16720 = ~I am truly saddened that you wish Minsc and Boo to leave. If you have any need for stout blade, and an even stouter man to swing it, do not hesitate to call on me.~
@16721 = ~I am truly saddened that you wish Minsc and Boo to leave. If you have any need for stout blade, and an even stouter man to swing it, do not hesitate to call on me. Let's go Dynaheir. You are safe with me regardless.~
@16722 = ~I fear that where Dynaheir goes, so must I! It must be both of us, or neither.~
@16723 = ~Then neither it must be. I do not need either of you.~
@16724 = ~~
@16725 = ~Then I shall welcome you both to the party.~
@16726 = ~Stand easy Minsc. They are to be trusted, for it was their valor that rescued me.~
@16727 = ~Now Minsc, that thick head is best left where it is, regardless of how little it is used. Thou shalt continue to accompany me as previously assigned. No doubt our new friends would welcome a warrior of thy... perseverance.~
@16728 = ~I am sorry, but I have space for Dynaheir alone.~
@16729 = ~If I have my choice, I should prefer to take Minsc on his own.~
@16730 = ~You are both welcome additions.~
@16731 = ~The choice thou makes dost puzzle me, but 'tis thine to make. So be it.~
@16732 = ~Sorry, but I should prefer it if both of your went on your way.~
@16733 = ~Pay him little mind. Minsc must make his "dejemma" by seeking adventure, while I must prove my worth to my... sisters in much the same manner. 'Tis an interesting time for the Realms, with great things foretold for the Sword Coast. Hopefully we shall all find what we seek.~
@16734 = ~If thou dost no longer desire my companionship, then so be it. I shall not force myself where I am not wanted.~
@16735 = ~If thou dost no longer desire my companionship, then so be it. I shall not force myself where I am not wanted. Come Minsc, we will continue on ourselves.~
@16736 = ~Thou hast proven to be quite a leader. I shall look forward to when we can again call each other comrade.~
@16737 = ~Thou hast proven to be quite a leader. I shall look forward to when we can again call each other comrade. Come along Minsc.~
@16738 = ~So the witch Dynaheir is dead! I would have thought her more formidable to be so far from her homeland. Why then was she here? Her demise is not the check-mate I had hoped for, merely the check. What? What do you want!? (Oh yes, the matter of payment, although I begin to doubt whether their input was all that vital. Still, something for their trouble is in order, if only to appease them.) As we never fixed a price your payment shall be one year of my services as a wizard. I am sure you agree that my guidance will be far more valuable than any monetary sum.~
@16739 = ~I suppose that shall suffice, though it's a dirty switch you've pulled.~
@16740 = ~Not to sleight your abilities, but I would rather have my payment in coin.~
@16741 = ~(Their desires lack vision and originality.) If simple coin be all you wish, perhaps I would rather travel with more "adventurous" adventurers. Take what I have, and remember your choice when it is long since spent.~
@16742 = ~You would cast me out as though I were a servant? (They will all pay for their insolence!)~
@16743 = ~You would have me leave the group? I agree to do so, but only as it serves my purposes for the time being. (I will wait here, but I am not a patient man.)~
@16744 = ~I shall watch thee as well, though I expect to receive less pleasure from my task than thou from thine.~
@16745 = ~Do you remember our agreement? You had agreed to help me kidnap Skie from the estate of Entar Silvershield. Well, I think this is the perfect opportunity. I could take us to the estate right now.~
@16746 = ~Not now.~
@16747 = ~Sure, lead the way.~
@16748 = ~You had agreed, if you're not going to live up to your part of the bargain, I'll find someone else who will.~
@16749 = ~Good riddance.~
@16750 = ~Hey, we're sorry. Take us to the estate.~
@16751 = ~Just follow me.~
@16752 = ~Aren't you coming?~
@16753 = ~This is the estate right here. Skie has told me that there is a secret door in the northern section of the wall. I'll find it.~
@16754 = ~We should sneak in and find her room. Once there, we'll sneak her out. We shouldn't kill any guards, as that will bring the wrath of the Flaming Fist down on our heads.~
@16755 = ~When the word stupidity was introduced to the language, they must have had you in mind. I'm not going to be a part of this group.~
@16756 = ~Skie! It's good to see you again, we're here to get you away from this place. These people with me are friends of mine; we're what you might call adventurers.~
@16757 = ~Let's get out of this place as soon as possible.~
@16758 = ~If you won't have Skie, then there's no place for me with you either.~
@16759 = ~I've got in contact with one of Entar Silvershield's agents. Seems dad is quite worried about his little girl. He's so worried that's he's willing to pay good money to make sure no harm comes to her. Every two days we're to go to the Blade and Stars and meet with someone named "Elkart." Elkart will give us the ransom money, and we can be on our way.~
@16760 = ~I'm back! I hope you all missed me dearly.~
@16761 = ~I would rather travel alone than spend a second more with you boorish oafs. Goodbye, and good riddance.~
@16762 = ~Well, as your best friend I can tell you a few things. There's been some economic troubles in Baldur's Gate. There's been a lack of iron, and with the tensions between Amn and Baldur's Gate, this has been causing some concern. A mercantile organization called the Iron Throne has been making some headway within the economic circles of Baldur's Gate.~
@16763 = ~I would rather travel alone than spend a second more with you boorish oafs. Goodbye, and good riddance. Come along Skie.~
@16764 = ~It is a pity. Our time together has been thoroughly charming. Perhaps we will meet again?~
@16765 = ~It is a pity. Our time together has been thoroughly charming. Perhaps we will meet again? Come along Skie.~
@16766 = ~My father never let me out much. I don't think there is anything I could tell you that would help you.~
@16767 = ~You... you don't want me anymore? But... but where will I go? Oh, this hasn't worked out like I'd hoped at all. You'll come back for me... right?~
@16768 = ~You... you don't want me anymore? But... but where will I go? Oh, this hasn't worked out like I'd hoped at all. You'll come back for me... right? Eldoth, you'll stay with me, won't you? Please?~
@16769 = ~Fine! I was going to leave soon anyway! You're really not the kind of people I should be traveling with.~
@16770 = ~Fine! I was going to leave soon anyway! You're really not the kind of people I should be traveling with. Eldoth is better company than you anyway.~
@16771 = ~What's taking you so long; remember we have an agreement.~
@16772 = ~We have agreed to help Safana recover a treasure in the talons of some type of monster. She was most persuasive when requesting our help. The treasure cove is located somewhere along the coast just south of Candlekeep.~
@16773 = ~Well, we have worked well together, wouldn't you agree? Perhaps we could continue this working relationship beyond just one treasure hunt, that is, if you'll have me. If you haven't guessed yet, my skills are of a thieving nature~
@16774 = ~We don't need another thief, not even an incredibly gorgeous one. (Wait! What are we saying?)~
@16775 = ~Sure you can work with us any time.~
@16776 = ~If that's the way you want to be, then I guess this is goodbye.~
@16777 = ~You've made the right decision boys, but now we should talk about the leadership of this group, I think it needs overhauling.~
@16778 = ~Why are you doing this, Angelo?~
@16779 = ~Your daughter is who speaks to you, Angelo; or have you somehow forgotten?~
@16780 = ~Ah, I'm finally released from this infernal duty! I swear by every god in a million pantheons that I will NEVER lose a duel to another overly masculine thug in my life.~
@16781 = ~Damn it, you lose one well-fought duel to an oafish lout of a man and you get attached. I almost hate to say it but you've earned my respect.~
@16782 = ~Well, look what I found; this is the body of Silvershield's son. Guess I'm in a lot of trouble now. With him dead, I'll be a wanted dwarf. From what I've gathered so far, all of you are after them damnable bandits. Well, since my reputation is now mud how 'bout I help you gain revenge on those scum bags.~
@16783 = ~We don't want you around any more, so hit the road.~
@16784 = ~Sure, we could use your skills.~
@16785 = ~Stupid chumps, your loss.~
@16786 = ~I don't have friends, so I don't get why you've suddenly come into my life. Well friends, if I had something to tell ya, I would, but I don't.~
@16787 = ~Heh, my reputation's probably calmed down by now, anyway. See ya around, ya lumps.~
@16788 = ~You've got hardy hides, folk. If you ever need a little more dwarven muscle around, you've got it.~
@16789 = ~Now, we must take the beast's head, and bring it to the Song of the Morning temple in Beregost. It is there that we can receive our reward.~
@16790 = ~I have a daughter? That's... that's ahhhhh... wonderful.~
@16791 = ~Her name's Namara... curse, what curse? Slow down and let me...~
@16792 = ~All right, I'll do this for my... ummmm... daughter. So friends, are you with me or not? 'Cause if you're not I'll have to do this alone.~
@16793 = ~We don't have time for stupid family problems; you're on your own.~
@16794 = ~Sure, we'll help you.~
@16795 = ~I'm sorry Briel, but I just don't have the time or inclination to care for your... I mean our child.~
@16796 = ~What knowledge would you like from me? I could tell you about the beautiful forests of Tethir, or the many gorgeous damsels that have fallen for my charms. I have studied up on the wyverns that prey upon the area. They have wicked barbs upon their tails, which they use to poison their victims. They are cruel beasts that enjoy inflicting suffering upon their prey. I really have not much more to say.~
@16797 = ~Mite pretty town, ain't this? A word to the wise, though: she's all surface. Scratch her a bit and that rot shines through, I tell ya. Check out the Undercellar, sometime... ye'll see what I'm meanin'.~
@16798 = ~Good Berry~
@16799 = ~Fighter~
@16800 = ~My dearest Mirianne,
The road has been difficult but I have arrived safely here in Amn. I think it would be wisest if I returned by sea, however, perhaps sometime after the first snows have fallen. I trust this letter reaches you. The halfling I hired to carry it struck me as an honest enough chap.

Always and forever,
Roe...~
@16801 = ~Hey... guys. Remember me, your old bud Husam. *hic* Iz so good to see ya all again. Lots has happenedz since ya were gone. Heh heh, ya I've beens hearing all sortsa things. I heards you guys are wanted for murders. Hah, so yers murderers eh. Well, I still like ya. Hey, I have somore info for yas. Do ya want ta here it?~
@16802 = ~What!?! I'ms not drunk, ya got me confused wit somebody else.~
@16803 = ~You there! I have come to speak with <CHARNAME>. Hast thou come to collect the inheritance from your father? He left thee several items, all of which are within his old room. You remember where his old room is, don't you? If you've somehow forgotten, it's on the fifth floor of the central keep. Please forgive my abrupt nature, but much requires my attention this day. It is important that we later speak of your foster father, but not now.~
@16804 = ~Hello, young one, I am sorry to see thee in such terrible circumstances. I know thee well enough to see that you have been falsely accused. Tomorrow Ulraunt will most likely sentence thee to be sent to Baldur's Gate. There, thou wouldst receive the death penalty for these actions. I know that Gorion would not want to see his only child killed a scant few weeks after his own death. 'Tis as a favor to his memory that I will help thee escape. Make thy way through the catacombs beneath the library, but disturb them not. I have your possessions with me; you must take them and go with haste.~
@16805 = ~It is good to see you again. The libraries are yours to use for the duration of our stay. Let me show you to your hostel room.~
@16806 = ~There are several rules that need be adhered to, of which you are no doubt aware. First, you are prohibited from taking any of the books from their respective rooms. Second, certain rooms will be inscribed with a rune, and are not to be entered. Third, you are not to stay within the confines of Candlekeep for more than ten days. Now follow me, I'll take you to your quarters.~
@16807 = ~I know of no one named Koveras, but Koveras is the reverse of Sarevok, a young man who accompanied the leaders of the Iron Throne when they first came. I know not where he has gone.~
@16808 = ~Do you know anyone by the name of Koveras?~
@16809 = ~Thank you for helping us.~
@16810 = ~You there! Stop and surrender yourself. You are accused of murdering the men Brunos Costak, Thaldorn Tenhevich and Rieltar Anchev. If you give yourself up now, you will be assured of a fair trial.~
@16811 = ~Don't let this happen, <CHARNAME>. If you resist, I'll be forced to use lethal force.~
@16812 = ~Bring it on!~
@16813 = ~Now that you put it that way... take us to your prison.~
@16814 = ~We didn't murder anyone, and we're not surrendering to the likes of you!~
@16815 = ~We didn't murder anyone, so we're perfectly willing to go to trial. Our innocence of this accusation should be refuted quickly, within any fair court of law.~
@16816 = ~It saddens me that is has come to this.~
@16817 = ~I'm glad you still have some of the sense Gorion taught you. Please, follow me. I'm sure everything will be sorted out quickly.~
@16818 = ~Fine, we'll be on our way.~
@16819 = ~You're the leaders of the Iron Throne! We're the ones who've caused you so much trouble over the past weeks. We know what your all about, and soon, so will Duke Eltan.~
@16820 = ~You're the bastards behind all of the troubles from here to Baldur's Gate. Now that we have you where we want you, don't think we're going to let you live!~
@16821 = ~You're the... and you're stupid enough to admit this. Well my young friend, you might find safety within the library, but once you've left there will be no place for you to run.~
@16822 = ~Now there's a face I never thought I'd see again in a million years. When we heard about Gorion's passing, Fuller and I went out to gather his body but you were nowhere to be seen. I don't know what you two came across that night but Gorion died a noble death saving you from it.~
@16823 = ~I need your help, Hull.~
@16824 = ~That night's all a blur. We were ambushed and he told me to run, so I did.~
@16825 = ~Thanks for taking care of his remains, Hull. I didn't have the means. Someday we'll sit down over a mug of ale and I'll tell you about it.~
@16826 = ~It's good that you did, kid, or you wouldn't be here to talk to me right now. There's never been any shame in running every now and again.~
@16827 = ~What kind of help?~
@16828 = ~Koveras~
@16829 = ~Can I have one of those potions of antidote you always had on you?~
@16830 = ~Koveras~
@16831 = ~What can you tell me about the Iron Throne?~
@16832 = ~Best hangover cure I ever found but, from the sounds of it, you've got a more important use for it. Here let me give you one now.~
@16833 = ~The Iron Throne? They're a merchants' guild, I think. Winthrop probably knows more about them than I do... On the other hand, two of them are in the libraries, right now. They've been around for a few days, now. Said they had some business to conduct here.~
@16834 = ~I look forward to it, kid.~
@16835 = ~Well I'll be! If that isn't someone with a tale to tell, I don't know who is. What have you been up to this past while?~
@16836 = ~I don't know, I guess I just took the long route home: The Friendly Arm, Beregost, Nashkel, Baldur's Gate...~
@16837 = ~Killing more kobolds than you could ever imagine. Hey, you wouldn't happen to need a few rusty old short swords, would you, because I've got tons.~
@16838 = ~I've been trying to get to the bottom of this metal crisis. I haven't put it all together yet but the Iron Throne has their hand in it somehow.~
@16839 = ~The Gate, is it? I hear that, if you can stand the smell, the night-life's great! You're taking me on an all-expenses-paid tour of the place, someday, you realize...~
@16840 = ~Always good for a laugh, you were... Hey, I'm uh... I'm sorry about Gorion and all... I guess you've seen more than just kobolds, haven't you...~
@16841 = ~The Iron Throne? Two of their leaders are here right now, in the Central Keep... I hope you know what you're doing because Candlekeep isn't the place for blind accusations. Look, we'll just pretend the topic never came up, okay?~
@16842 = ~Oh! Why hello. Have you seen my book... Wait. No, you found that already, didn't you? Oh, I just don't know anymore. You haven't been around lately, have you...~
@16843 = ~No, I haven't been back since Gorion died...~
@16844 = ~Never change, Phlydia. We love you just the way you are.~
@16845 = ~No, I've been out investigating the iron crisis.~
@16846 = ~Gorion! Why yes, of course! I'm sorry, I've made a boor of myself again... Gorion was a good and wise sage and he obviously raised you with better manners than I would have been able to.~
@16847 = ~Why that's enough to make an old woman blush. Gorion sure raised a charmer in you.~
@16848 = ~Iron crisis? We have an iron crisis? Quick, someone had better notify the Gatewarden!~
@16849 = ~You've been Away WithOut Leave, soldier! Are you expecting forgiveness? Are you expecting redemption? Well, spare me! I want 500 push-ups and I want them NOW!!!!~
@16850 = ~Petulant, sniveling rat's dung, that's all you are...~
@16851 = ~My book... Do I have it or don't I?~
@16852 = ~You probably have more important things to be doing right now. We'll catch up on old times later.~
@16853 = ~Yeah, I'm on duty right now but maybe we can share a few drinks when my shift's over.~
@16854 = ~<CHARNAME>!! I didn't think you were ever coming back! What's it like out there?~
@16855 = ~~
@16856 = ~It's pretty scary, Dreppin. There's more to that iron crisis than the bandits everyone always talks about.~
@16857 = ~It's a lot of fun. I'm not going to be here for long. You should come with me when I go.~
@16858 = ~It's big. I don't know how else to put it. I lived my entire life within these walls and in the past while I've seen fifty times as much as these walls could ever hold. It's weird, though: all that space and barely a book in it. I never realized how special Candlekeep really is.~
@16859 = ~Yeah? Like what?~
@16860 = ~I found a bunch of kobolds tainting the ore at the Nashkel mine with an acid of some sort. That's just the tip of the iceberg, too. It's going on all over the place.~
@16861 = ~There's a merchants' league called the Iron Throne at the bottom of all of it. They're in it for the money but there's something more, too. I just have to find out what it all is.~
@16862 = ~Let me guess, they want to form an independent kobold city-state, too, right? Why don't you just 'fess up and admit that you've spent the past while as a baker's apprentice or whatever and stop trying to pull my leg.~
@16863 = ~Iron Throne? A couple of them came here the other day and headed into the Central Library. I wouldn't have remembered it but one of them looked at me as he walked by and it just sent shivers up and down my spine. They should still be around but, if I were you, I'd stay as far away from them as possible.~
@16864 = ~Like you'd ever need a stablehand. Me and Arabelle are staying right here, thank you very much.~
@16865 = ~Yeah, people come from all over to see the books here. All sorts of folks, too: bards, nobles, priests, mages. Volo's even been here and Elminster, too, remember. A couple of just plain old merchants even wandered in the other day. Said they were with the Iron Throne and were here to do some business. They're still around, last I heard.~
@16866 = ~Yup, welcome home... Same old, same old, huh?~
@16867 = ~Aye, now there's the rapscallion! Set on the little wisp, now, and make every bolt count!~
@16868 = ~Winthrop, you old fool! If I had an arrow for every one of these practical jokes you've played on me, I'd... I'd... I don't know, I'd have a lot of arrows! Well met, my friend.~
@16869 = ~Where are they? Call them off, Winthrop, I didn't do anything!~
@16870 = ~You'll never take me alive!!!~
@16871 = ~-sigh-... I was hoping your journey into the big world might have put a better humor into ye but methinks my hopes have failed me. What have ye been up to out there, child?~
@16872 = ~I've been trying to get to the bottom of this metal crisis. A merchants' guild is involved, somehow. Iron Throne. Do you know anything about them?~
@16873 = ~Wearing out your cheap merchandise, what else?~
@16874 = ~The Iron Throne, child... Why there be no bigger or more dastardly mercantile consortium in all the Western Realms. They've been barred from Cormyr for their unsavory practices but all it's done is make them nastier. Ye'd best steer clear of them as long as ye've still got life in ye.~
@16875 = ~Har, ye've got a better sense of humor than I pegged ye for... that was a joke, wasn't it?~
@16876 = ~Yes, ye'd run me right out of the fletching business in a flash, ye would! It's good to see your impish face again! Now fill me in on what it is ye've been doing lately.~
@16877 = ~I've been trying to get to the bottom of this metal crisis. A merchants' guild is involved, somehow. Iron Throne. Do you know anything about them?~
@16878 = ~I've been adventuring, Winthrop. There's a world out there and it needs a righteous old kick in the arse every now and again, doesn't it?~
@16879 = ~Spoken with the wisdom of a true fool! By the gods, I love this bastard child!~
@16880 = ~Whoa, calm down, kiddo. That big old world has tied yer britches in a knot, han't she... It's just good old Winthrop trying to pull yer leg again... I guess having to see Gorion die like that has its effect on a kid, eh? I'll keep my jokes to myself, next time, I guess.~
@16881 = ~Down to business, then, is it? We got ale, we got armor, we got... Ah hell, this is old hat. Ye know what it is we all got.~
@16882 = ~Ah, I thought I might find you somewhere around here. Allow me to introduce myself...~
@16883 = ~Perhaps another time. There is some... research that I am currently working on which demands my attention.~
@16884 = ~Please do...~
@16885 = ~Research... Well, indeed, that makes two of us and I think I might know what you're looking for. Will you let me be of some small assistance?~
@16886 = ~Thank you but no. They are studies of a more private nature...~
@16887 = ~Tell me, what exactly is it that I am looking for?~
@16888 = ~Winthrop~
@16889 = ~Winthrop~
@16890 = ~Mm... My apologies for the intrusion, then.~
@16891 = ~You are looking for the truth, as are we all... My name is Koveras. I used to work for your father, running messages to his Harper friends in Waterdeep. Before he passed on, he entrusted this ring to me and asked that I give it to you should evil ever befall him... Will you take it?~
@16892 = ~Well, evil befell him, alright, but I want nothing of your baubles.~
@16893 = ~It is now time for you to go, <CHARNAME>. I can teleport you to the secret room that leads to the catacombs, but from there you are on your own. You must be careful within the catacombs, as there are many guardians and traps, and perhaps whoever planned these murders. However dangerous the catacombs may be, they are a safer alternative to Ulraunt's wrath.~
@16894 = ~And what evil befell him, Koveras?~
@16895 = ~If it was my father's wish, then I shall wear it. Thank you for your kindness to him, Koveras.~
@16896 = ~Surely you are not blind to the Iron Throne presence in these halls! Don't be a fool... Your father knew this was no bauble, and if you have even an ounce of his wisdom, you would know the same! Now take it before I lose my patience with you!~
@16897 = ~I have made up my mind and it will take more than your words to change it. Keep your ring, I want it not.~
@16898 = ~Forgive me, Koveras. There are so few people to trust and so, in my foolishness, I spurn them all, friend and foe alike. Give me my father's ring that I might relieve you of its burden.~
@16899 = ~Do not tempt me, wardling. If you refuse to take the ring, then at least listen to some advice. The people you deal with are very dangerous, and they guard themselves well. Right now they are at their weakest. If you strike at them now, while they least expect it, you might be able to end the threat that they pose to the Sword Coast. You can take this advice or discard it, I do not care. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@16900 = ~Wear it with your father's pride about you, then. Before you go, listen to me well. The leaders of the Iron Throne are here in the keep even as we speak. They are at their weakest and most unprotected... if you ever hope to kill them, now is the time. Now go, the Iron Throne awaits you.~
@16901 = ~You were there, you saw it all. A woman, an armored figure, two ogres wielding clubs. But Gorion's petty magic was of little use against them, was it not? And you, you fled with your tail between your legs, hiding amidst the trees until dawn broke. And now, it comes full circle, doesn't it. The Iron Throne so close that you can almost touch them and wreak your revenge for that night.~
@16902 = ~You know me well, Koveras, and my father, too. Give me that ring and let me find my vengeance.~
@16903 = ~You're right, Koveras. I was there. Myself, my father, and four others who tried to kill us. Where were you, if you know so much?~
@16904 = ~If you be so void of trust, I am surprised you have made it this far. It is of little matter. Go seek your vengeance or your doom at the hand of the Iron Throne. I wash my hands of it.~
@16905 = ~My name is Koveras. I used to work for your father, running messages to his Harper friends in Waterdeep. Before he passed on, he entrusted this ring to me and asked that I give it to you should evil ever befall him... Will you take it?~
@16906 = ~Well, evil befell him, alright, but I want nothing of your baubles.~
@16907 = ~And what evil befell him, Koveras?~
@16908 = ~If it is my father's will, than I shall wear it. Thank you for your kindness to him, Koveras.~
@16909 = ~We'd rather not get information from a drunken lunatic.~
@16910 = ~What do you have for us?~
@16911 = ~Well, heh heh, quites a bit I have, quites a bit. Does ya know about Duke Eltan, he's diseased heez is. His seconds in command *hic* Scar got killed, assassassinated heez was. *buuuuuurp* Sose that's it. I gots to get going now, if you wants to talk with me some more just come by the Blushing Mermaid. See yas.~
@16912 = ~-buuurp- Hey again. Iz me, Husam. I gotta talk to yas. Jez follow me.~
@16913 = ~Fine thens, I'll find some other frens.~
@16914 = ~Sorry for misleading you, but there are times when subtlety works better than honesty. My associates and I don't want a fight, so we could ease the tension if all of us sheathed our weapons.~
@16915 = ~We don't trust you one bit, prepare to defend yourselves.~
@16916 = ~Okay, we don't want a fight either, we'll give you a chance to explain yourself. The truth this time.~
@16917 = ~Okay then. First off, my name really is Husam. I have never owned a business in Baldur's Gate. My associates and I belong to an organization called the Shadow Thieves; I'm sure you've heard of us. I'm here in the Gate because of the lies being spread about our organization and the nation of Amn as a whole. I'm sure you're aware how you were framed as Amnian assassins while in Candlekeep, or how the deaths of Duke Entar Silvershield and commander Scar were blamed on the Shadow Thieves. Well... we had nothing to do with it. It seems that someone is going to a lot of trouble to create a feeling of animosity between Baldur's Gate and Amn. Amn has never been interested in a war with this city and has definitely not been responsible for all of the troubles in this region. All of that can be placed squarely upon the shoulders of the Iron Throne, or more specifically Sarevok. Now that I've told you who I am, perhaps you can tell me who you are.~
@16918 = ~We're just mercenaries. We've been hired by Duke Eltan to investigate the Iron Throne.~
@16919 = ~We're currently operating with Zhentarim backing. They've had their identities misused as well.~
@16920 = ~We're working with Harper assistance.~
@16921 = ~You don't need to know who we are.~
@16922 = ~Mercenaries, huh? Well your employer isn't in the best of shape right now, so perhaps you need some help.~
@16923 = ~Sorry, we work alone.~
@16924 = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@16925 = ~The Zhentarim: an organization after my own heart. Well, we seem to have the same problem, so perhaps working together wouldn't be a bad thing.~
@16926 = ~Sorry, we work alone.~
@16927 = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@16928 = ~Harpers. They seem to meddle in everyone's affairs.~
@16929 = ~Well, in that case, we wouldn't want to meddle in any of your affairs. Goodbye.~
@16930 = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@16931 = ~Fair enough, but I do know that you're an enemy of the Iron Throne, and an enemy of an enemy is a friend.~
@16932 = ~Sorry, we work alone.~
@16933 = ~How did you plan on helping us?~
@16934 = ~I've been tracking the movements of two Night Masks who've been operating in the city over the past few weeks. I'd say they were responsible for framing the past several murders on the Shadow Thieves. I know they've been staying at a place called the Undercellar. How 'bout we pay them a visit.~
@16935 = ~No thanks, we have other things to do than track down assassins (but we're not sure what).~
@16936 = ~Show us the way.~
@16937 = ~Just follow us to the Ilmater shrine, it has one of the entrances to the Undercellar.~
@16938 = ~Here we are. The entrance is just in the back. We'll stay up here and run interference. The two you're looking for are named Slythe and Krystin. Talk to the priest of Ilmater in the temple, he'll get you into the Undercellar. Meet us up here when you've dealt with the assassins.~
@16939 = ~How did you fare?~
@16940 = ~We killed both of them.~
@16941 = ~We didn't find anybody.~
@16942 = ~They should be down there; I had guards on all of the entrances. Go back and try again.~
@16943 = ~Good, did you find anything on their bodies?~
@16944 = ~No, we didn't.~
@16945 = ~We found several documents spelling out their next assassination. They were to join with a group of doppelgangers to kill the two remaining Grand Dukes during the election. We also found an invitation to Sarevok's coronation on their bodies.~
@16946 = ~That's happening tonight! If they succeed, Sarevok will have seized control of the entire city. We should move immediately; we have to get to the Dukes before it's too late. We must gain entrance to the palace. You can use the invitation you found. The rest of us will see if we can gain access though the sewers of the city. I don't know how successful we'll be, so it's really up to you, <CHARNAME>.~
@16947 = ~Here we are. From what I know, there's a secret entrance into the palace, via the sewers. Unfortunately, it's heavily warded and guarded. That's where you come in. You'll have to disable the wards and traps. Once we're inside, us Shadow Thieves will create a diversion for the rest of you. You make your way to the election room, find out who the doppelgangers are and kill them. Remember, make sure you know who the doppelgangers are. If you're right they'll revert to their true form; if you're wrong, you're in a heap of trouble. Here is where the location of the secret door is. It's all up to you.~
@16948 = ~Here's the secret entrance, it's up to you now. Get us through this without anyone dying.~
@16949 = ~Sorry Husam, we don't have time for your wacky antics right now.~
@16950 = ~Okay, show us where you want us to go.~
@16951 = ~I've got a way out of here, you know... Heh, hidden it well, haven't I? Search all you want and you won't find it, heh heh.~
@16952 = ~Heh, good thing ol' Neb decided to mix a little bit of illusioncraft with his thievery, eh? Sure, sure... I'll tell you what. Murderer to murderer, now, monster to monster, are you wanting out?~
@16953 = ~Please, we'll do whatever it takes... It's very important that we get out of here.~
@16954 = ~I'd rather rot in this cell than be indebted to the likes of you.~
@16955 = ~Heh, sure, sure, everyone's wanting out but does the world really want us out? Maybe it's safer if we all just stay in here, heh... Monster to monster, now, murderer to murderer, how many little children passed away at old Neb's hands? Not 1, not 2, neither 4 nor 7 nor 12 nor 20 but the next one, the next one in the sequence...~
@16956 = ~You killed 26 children, Neb... A murderer and a monster, indeed.~
@16957 = ~You killed 38 children, Neb... How could you?~
@16958 = ~You killed 18 children, Neb... The very thought of it sickens me.~
@16959 = ~You killed 41 children, Neb... May you rot for as many lifetimes in this cell.~
@16960 = ~You killed 33 children, Neb... May the gods and all their solars wreak their vengeance.~
@16961 = ~You killed 76 children, Neb... All this and no remorse.~
@16962 = ~You killed 30 children, Neb... Do their voices not haunt you in your sleep?~
@16963 = ~You killed 38 children, Neb... May your gnomish soul burn in each of the Nine Hells.~
@16964 = ~Let the solars come and I shall kill them too! In a world without justice, the gods are little more than a divine puppet show. Come, the tunnel's through the wall, here, and it is time we cut ourselves free from this confining womb.~
@16965 = ~Thirty-three! Thirty-three! The entire world should know that Neb murdered thirty-three children in the dead of night! And then you speak of it so disdainfully, too, as if it were beneath you... How many did you kill, then? Thirty-four?~
@16966 = ~Hey there fellas, I assume Husam sent ya. Well ya better hurry, there ain't much time to dawdle. Just follow me, I'll show ya the entrance to the palace.~
@16967 = ~Heh, then rot you will, rot you will...~
@16968 = ~Heh heh... so you still want to get out, do you? Yes, I do hold the power in this situation, don't I... You can love me, you can hate me, it doesn't matter... You still must do as I wish. Quick, now, a riddle for my captive audience: If you look at me, we look at each other, you with eyes and me with yours. If you speak to me, I only mime your words for while I wear your lips, I have no voice. What am I, foolish ones? What am I?~
@16969 = ~A potato.~
@16970 = ~A mannequin.~
@16971 = ~A squid.~
@16972 = ~The wind.~
@16973 = ~A doppelganger.~
@16974 = ~A lover.~
@16975 = ~A mirror.~
@16976 = ~Time.~
@16977 = ~~
@16978 = ~Wrong again! Who knows, maybe I give you riddles with no answers. I love it. I love power. Can you feel it? Ha ha ha...~
@16979 = ~A mirror, yes... Like you to me or me to you, we are the same, we are siblings separated by a thin and fragile pane of silvered glass. Come, let me show you my tunnel that we might make good our escape, my twin!~
@16980 = ~Yes, another riddle, ha ha! Another riddle for the little children! ...I have never been and have yet to be. None have ever seen me nor ever shall. The wise plan for my coming yet will never find me while fools forget I exist and pay when they meet me... Who am I, children? Tell me who I am!~
@16981 = ~You are death.~
@16982 = ~You are tomorrow.~
@16983 = ~You are old age.~
@16984 = ~You are sleep.~
@16985 = ~You are the night.~
@16986 = ~You are Judgement.~
@16987 = ~You are the ocean tide.~
@16988 = ~Yesterday, today, tomorrow, I would change none of it! Come, children, my tunnel is just over here. Old Neb will see you safely to its end.~
@16989 = ~Foolish children!!! You lack the wisdom of age and at this rate you shall ne'er live to gain it! Talk to me again when you have some sense.~
@16990 = ~My siblings, you have worked me into quite the lather. Now leave me be that I might seek my victims more stealthily.~
@16991 = ~I am again in your debt. That creature has kept me helpless for too long. Perhaps if I hadn't been incapacitated I might have been able to prevent Scar's death. *cough* Angelo will soon hear of my recovery. It is important that you take me away from here; I'm sure Angelo won't want me coherent and among the living. Take me to the harbormasters building. The harbormaster is a good friend of mine. I can rest there until I'm fully recovered. Take this letter, I managed to filch it off Rashad when he was "caring" for me. From what I read of it, it seems that Sarevok has dire plans for the city. I fear for the lives of my fellow dukes, Liia and Belt. If they were to die, Sarevok would take over the city. You must find Slythe and Krystin, and stop them... -cough-... Hurry, we must make haste.~
@16992 = ~I should be safe here; in the mean time, you have quite the task ahead of you. If I'm right, the Iron Throne is going to stage a coup. You're the only ones who'll be able to stop them.~
@16993 = ~What are you still doing here? You have much to do, hurry!~
@16994 = ~If you don't have an invitation citizen, then all you're doing is wasting our time. Please move along.~
@16995 = ~The Storehouse~
@16996 = ~The inner grounds~
@16997 = ~West to Candlekeep~
@16998 = ~Telescope~
@16999 = ~Telescope~
@17000 = ~Ah, suffer long, this unholy flesh.~
@17001 = ~Yes, yes. Go in pain, then, child. Go in pain.~
@17002 = ~Yes, suffer long, my brother. I must go now.~
@17003 = ~Unholy flesh, is it? Yet is not flesh a thing of beauty, created in the very image of the divine?~
@17004 = ~I fear I will never understand your faith, brother. Our souls are tortured enough... Why is it that our flesh must also suffer?~
@17005 = ~The divine... Heavenly thighs, the ruddy locks of Sune, herself... Aye, there be a bit of the divine in each succubus, erinye, or alu-fiend. The Nine Hells are full of good men and women burning in the very flames of their fallen passion!~
@17006 = ~Or is it the reverse? Our flesh is tortured because our souls are not troubled by the flesh's actions.~
@17007 = ~And who is Sune?~
@17008 = ~And burn they should. Love is a pure chalice not to be tainted with the poisoned wine of passion.~
@17009 = ~And are there no shades of gray?~
@17010 = ~Sune, Lady Firehair, the goddess of passion... I have met her in her earthly form in a... in an establishment near here...~
@17011 = ~And what a sweet poison it is...~
@17012 = ~What shades of gray can you place on passion? It is a wild array of reds and violets and yellows, a heavenly kaleidoscope of flesh... But think not of it, lest it tempt you to your doom.~
@17013 = ~I have little desire to hear of your foolish fantasies.~
@17014 = ~And where might this... establishment... be?~
@17015 = ~I... But... Begone, or... or suffer the wrath of the gods upon your sinful flesh! I never spoke to you and know you not!~
@17016 = ~Ssh, you must... you must tell no one... It is called the Undercellar and I have a... a secret passage from my quarters. Would you... like to see?~
@17017 = ~Yes, I would be most interested.~
@17018 = ~Perhaps another time.~
@17019 = ~Come with me, then.~
@17020 = ~Yes, yes, of course... You know where to find me.~
@17021 = ~And what actions might those be, priest?~
@17022 = ~In truth, I am a fan of neither rhetoric nor theology. Let me be, priest.~
@17023 = ~There is a... a place I frequent, a woman I see...~
@17024 = ~A place? ...Is it nearby?~
@17025 = ~A woman? What need has a priest for a woman?~
@17026 = ~There is... There is nothing written against it... She gives me pain. She is my penance... What is wrong in that?~
@17027 = ~Ah, it is you, the one who took such an interest in the theological nature of the flesh and its sins... There be a passageway leading off my quarters which might allow you to investigate such sins close at hand... It, ahem, leads to a place called the Undercellar. Would you be interested in accompanying me?~
@17028 = ~Nothing. Nothing, brother, I merely asked.~
@17029 = ~There is plenty wrong in it, brother, and you should not need me to tell you so.~
@17030 = ~Well, well, well, dear. What have we here... blade fodder?~
@17031 = ~Yes, show me to the Undercellar.~
@17032 = ~The Undercellar? Perhaps another time...~
@17033 = ~Pain, oh dear sweet pain. I shall suffer your wrath and find my peace in it.~
@17034 = ~I don't know, Slythe. They're so big and threatening... Oh, my mistake, I was thinking of someone else.~
@17035 = ~Ooh, she's got a tongue of steel and a heart of gold, my Krystin does... And she's so pretty that she makes herself all invisible so guys don't give her hassle. Not that they would with a tough guy like me looking after her, of course...~
@17036 = ~Slythie-baby, you tell them honey...~
@17037 = ~Bah, Krystin, don't give it all away like that, now. It's on... what do they call that again, the silver bladder? ...Ah, enough of this cat and mouse stuff, anyhow. I ain't cut out for it. We'll kill 'em now and do the Dukes after lunch like Sarevok said us to.~
@17038 = ~Mmm, I love you for your mind, Slythe.~
@17039 = ~Hmph. I bet you aren't going to the inauguration ceremony.~
@17040 = ~What inauguration ceremony?~
@17041 = ~I've got an invitation just like everyone else in this town, so shove it.~
@17042 = ~I'd like to but I don't have an invitation yet.~
@17043 = ~They're crowning Sarevok as the new Grand Duke. Anyone who's anyone knows that.~
@17044 = ~Sarevok? What do you think of him?~
@17045 = ~Lookit, I'm not here to be pushed around by some two-bit hustler in a clown suit, alright?~
@17046 = ~This city needs a strong hand to get rid of riff-raff like yourselves. Personally, I think he'll do wonderfully.~
@17047 = ~You have no idea what you're getting yourselves into. Sarevok is no leader. He is a tyrant and must be stopped.~
@17048 = ~Hail Sarevok. May he breathe wealth and power into this city.~
@17049 = ~Blah, blah, blah... You groundlings are all the same. Go fight your petty revolution elsewhere.~
@17050 = ~Hail Sarevok.~
@17051 = ~Pity. This city has lost all sense of proper standards and etiquette... Sarevok will change that, I have no doubt.~
@17052 = ~I returned a flamedance ring to Joia in the Friendly Arm Inn. She was very appreciative, even if she had no gold to give me.~
@17053 = ~Joia~
@17054 = ~A ring is a small band of precious metal that is used as jewelry. Some rare rings have had enchantments placed upon them that confer various magical abilities. These rings are highly sought after, especially by those of the adventuring profession.~
@17055 = ~Go to the stupid inauguration, then. I've got better things to do with my time.~
@17056 = ~Joia~
@17057 = ~Don't make me laugh, peasant...~
@17058 = ~Hmph. Like playing in the sewers, I suppose...~
@17059 = ~I know your type. All words and no action. Go ahead, take your best shot!~
@17060 = ~Why the gall of you... Guards! Guards! Seize these vandals!!!~
@17061 = ~And thank the gods for that! Rubbing shoulders with the likes of you would probably give me tetanus...~
@17062 = ~Don't judge adventurers by the roughness of their garb. It is a rare day when we don't see a treasure your sheltered mind has never even dreamed of... How much are you asking for that invitation of yours?~
@17063 = ~Then go to your silly inauguration. I've got better things to do.~
@17064 = ~The only way you'll catch tetanus is at the edge of our swords. Now hand over the invitation before we slit your throat.~
@17065 = ~The only way you'll catch tetanus is at the edge of our swords. Now hand over the invitation or we'll slit your throat.~
@17066 = ~Away with you, beggar. I have had enough of your white-knuckled pleading.~
@17067 = ~Please, you must help me get into that inauguration ceremony. I pray to all the gods that act kindly upon me now.~
@17068 = ~Psst! Hey you, ya wanna schmooze with the Dukes?~
@17069 = ~Do what with the who?~
@17070 = ~Can you get me in?~
@17071 = ~Schmooze with the Dukes, kick up your heels with the Big Guys... You see, Entar Silvershield was off'd by the Shadow Thieves so they're naming this guy Sarevok as the new Grand Duke. And you can't name a new Duke without a big party, right?~
@17072 = ~Sarevok?~
@17073 = ~Mm. I think I'll give it a pass. Sarevok's bad news and I'd rather stay as far away from him as I can.~
@17074 = ~This might be useful. Can you get me in?~
@17075 = ~Well, have a look at my wares. These here are high quality forgeries of the official invitation. Use at your own risk, though, 'cause the guards might take a second look at the likes of you. Just 'cause we're chums, though, I'll give it to ya for a clean 150 gp. Is that good?~
@17076 = ~That'll be great. Here's the 150 gp right now.~
@17077 = ~Maybe another time.~
@17078 = ~Can you get me in?~
@17079 = ~Can you get me in?~
@17080 = ~This might be useful. Can you get me in?~

@17082 = ~Well, have a look at my wares. These here are high quality forgeries of the official invitation. Use at your own risk, though, 'cause the guards might take a second look at the likes of you. You're a tough kind of customer so how about I give it to ya for 200 gp. That sound good?~
@17083 = ~Sounds great. I've got the 200 gp right here.~
@17084 = ~Maybe some other time.~
@17085 = ~Well, have a look at my wares. These here are high quality forgeries of the official invitation. Use at your own risk, though, 'cause the guards might take a second look at the likes of you. I'm taking extra risks giving this out to your type, you realize, so it's gonna cost a little more than usual. Does 250 gp sound good?~
@17086 = ~250 gp! You're not just a forger, you're a thief, too. Here's the money, now give me that invitation.~
@17087 = ~Maybe some other time, Ignatio.~
@17088 = ~Yeah. Dig his style, too. Spikes and armor all over the place. Remind me to stay on his good side... if he has one, that is.~
@17089 = ~So can you get me in?~
@17090 = ~So can you get me in?~
@17091 = ~So can you get me in?~
@17092 = ~Trust me, he doesn't.~
@17093 = ~Ay, you look like you'd know. Well, run while you can 'cause them Dukes have long arms, you see... Longer arms than folks like you or I would ever want to encounter.~
@17094 = ~Ay, well I'll be around here somewheres, just in case you change you mind. Keep your head down out there, you hear?~
@17095 = ~It's been a pleasure doing a little bit of illicit business with ya, then. Keep your head down out there, now, will ya?~
@17096 = ~I don't recommend throwing your weight around in a place like this. You're liable to get hurt.~

@17276 = ~The Golden Pantaloons did surely see the very beginnings of our realm; though I must press that they "saw" this formative time by their simple presence, and not through some vestigial eyes that might have erupted through a rear pocket perhaps concealing teeth and other improbable extremities. I am sure that the various owners of the pantaloons can attest to the general lack of animated digits or ocular sensors, as evidenced by the continued sanctity and privacy maintained by their respective buttocks.

Lyric pantoums of an age long since out of print speak of "trousers that were as metal, though soft about the shanks." While it might be easy to jump to the seemingly inevitable conclusion that the trousers rose while Netheril fell, it is doubtful that the pantaloons were the garments of which they speak. One must clarify these oft-misquoted verses with knowledge of the Pantechnicon, an ancient bazaar once prized for Silver Pantalets. Fine these may have been, but golden they were not. Nickel Panties are also said to be currently available, though the dockside establishments that claim to offer these products are beyond my meager experience, and thus I can make no report.

The purpose of the Pantaloons is as mysterious as ever, and will likely remain so until the Pantocrator himself returns, though some properties can be divined though intimate observation. The "uplifting" properties of the gusset very nearly defy gravity, shaping quite nicely both the front and rear. This improved contour would likely increase self-esteem for a wearer of either sex. I would hazard a guess, however, that this continuing self delusion might actually hamper cognitive functions, and care should be taken in the wearing of any pantaloons of golden nature.~

@17336 = ~Stand away from me! I've very little trust left after last night's events, and I'll not waste any on you!~
@17337 = ~I apologize for the outburst, but I am in dire straits. Can you help me?~
@17338 = ~Could you help me? My foster father and I were attacked last eve, and now I'm not sure where to go.~
@17339 = ~I would have your assistance. I was ambushed in the night and I require whatever you can give.~
@17340 = ~You saw two people in the wood? I was told to meet some friends at the Friendly Arm Inn. Perhaps they and the ones you met are one in the same.~
@17341 = ~Why are you in the woods? I have heard nothing but how dangerous they are.~
@17342 = ~Why are you in the woods? I have heard nothing but how dangerous they are.~
@17343 = ~I doubt these are the ones you seek. They do not seem the friendly type, and are far afield of the Inn. If you wish to meet them, I left them not a moment ago just up the road. You will have to pass them anyway if you wish to go to the Friendly Arm. There is a crossroads a ways to the east and the Inn is north of that.~
@17344 = ~Thanks for your time. I shall be on my way.~
@17345 = ~Could you help me? My foster father and I were attacked last eve, and now I'm not sure where to go.~
@17346 = ~I have little to give besides advice and good will. Make friends where you can, as traveling alone is almost certain death.

@17350 = ~Fare thee well, as they say.~
@17351 = ~Me? Oh, I'm a hermit. Well, I'm rather new at it actually, and I haven't quite got the isolation bit down yet. Too much of a people-person, I suppose. Used to be a merchant in Nashkel I did, but lost everything due to the iron shortage. Been wandering the woods for a while now and it's been rather relaxing, I must say. Aside from eluding the occasional bandit, that is. I'm generally left alone because I have nothing of value.~
@17352 = ~I must apologize, but your interest makes me a touch uncomfortable. Suffice to say that I lost my livelihood due to the iron shortage, and now I take solace in the normally quiet woods. I am left alone because I carry nothing of value.~
@17353 = ~What of the two people you saw? I was to seek friends at the Friendly Arm Inn. Perhaps these were them?~
@17354 = ~Could you assist me? My foster father and I were attacked last eve, and now I'm not sure where to go.~

@17359 = ~Then I've not the time for you. Leave me.~
@17360 = ~Well, I imagine you're either the cause or a victim of the carnage I heard to the north last night then. It's a shame what the iron shortage has done to people's manners. You would do well to treat people you meet with a touch more respect, at least until you determine if they're a threat or not. You'll not get far if don't make friends, though there are a couple of fellows on the road to the east that would suit your demeanor quite nicely, I am sure.~
@17361 = ~If I wished your opinion I would have asked for it. Leave me.~
@17362 = ~The carnage to the north must be the aftermath of your little skirmish then. I am most assuredly sorry about your predicament, though there be little I can do for you. I've nothing of serviceable value to impart, except common sense and a few directions. A ways east of here you should find a crossroads. North of there is the Friendly Arm Inn, and south is the town of Beregost. Both can offer shelter, though rates at the Friendly Arm are likely better. It is a friendlier atmosphere for the young adventurer as well. Staying close to the roads will make your journey safer, but that will depend on where you are heading as well. I cannot accompany you, though there were a pair of travelers not far up the road. They might offer assistance, but I would be wary of the cost. I didn't like the look of them, myself.~
@17363 = ~I thank you for your time. Good luck in your travels.~
@17364 = ~Can you do nothing else? I could use any help.~
@17365 = ~If all you can offer is mere directions, I have no time for you. Leave me.~
@17366 = ~I have no doubt such a harsh request is backed by threats of violence. No matter, for I have little to give besides advice and good will, misplaced though it may be.

@17452 = ~What needs to be guarded in a camp full of heavily armed bandits?~
@17453 = ~What if I don't want you for a boss?~
@17454 = ~If you say so, but I'll wait to hear it from that Tazok fellow.~
@17455 = ~Good Attitude! Important work it is! Gotta keep an eye on Tazok's tent and make sure no one gets too close. They do super secret planning in there, all about where the iron and stuff goes. Smack anybody who goes near! Hey, maybe we'll give you a little test. You can guard the place for tonight. Tazok will be pleased that we took initinivvi... initititive... ini... that we didn't wait. It'll give me a break for tonight too. You just make sure nothing goes missing, or your head goes next.~
@17456 = ~Lots of people say that. "What do we need guards for?" "What's so special 'bout Tazok's tent." "Must not be very important if Credus can guard it." Well they know nothing! Credus guards really well and a good thing too. Not many people know, but Tazok keeps important stuff in there. Papers and things. You just watch your step at night, because I have to thump anyone who comes near. No exceptions. I better go, so you be careful.~
@17457 = ~You should be glad to get me! I'm tough, I'm dependable, and... I also know what it's like to be the new guy. Had to fight to get respect. At first they didn't want me guarding Tazok's tent. They said I would fall asleep, or blab about the papers. Well I know better, and I proved it! So you just count your lucky sheep that I'm on duty, cuz maybe I'll put in a good word for you. Or maybe not! I'll decide later.~
@17458 = ~Oh, you don't want to be talking to him. Tazok is kinda scary. I do a good job guarding his tent so he's only smacked me once, but if you talk too much he might hurt you worse. Especially if you interrupt him reading his important papers. Just guard them and shut up, that's what I say. I better go. Talking about Tazok is bad for your health.~
@17459 = ~Yeah, I was like that once. Then I met Tazok. Now I keep my mouth shut and does what I'm told! You should too, even if it's guarding stupid ol' papers like I have to do. I dunno what Tazok sees in them, but he sure keeps them locked up tight in his tent. I better go, but just you remember what I said. Do what you're told.~
@17460 = ~Yeah! You snap to it, just like I had too. It's gonna be great being the boss for a change! No more standing around for hours guarding stupid papers and garbage. It's not as if we need guards for Tazok's tent. No one is dumb enough to cross him. Anyway, you'll be my helper from now on. Maybe tonight you should guard Tazok's tent. We'll break you in so he don't do it. You just make sure nothing goes missing, or your head will be next.~
@17461 = ~Don't you go pestering me. I gotta get back to work.~
@17462 = ~Now I have to thump you good. Can't let you into the boss' tent, or you'll get his important stuff. Sorry, but you gotta die.~

@17466 = ~I did what was necessary. That is all.~
@17467 = ~I was not aware that my actions were common knowledge.~
@17468 = ~Perhaps, perhaps not, but I have seen much in my many years. I would agree, however, that I have not often seen the like of thee. Still, Gorion had faith in thee, and therefore I have no question as to thy competency. All that remains is to determine motive.~
@17469 = ~Perhaps not common knowledge, but everything is plain for those that know where to look. As it is, I am aware of thine efforts and accomplishments. Thou art quite adept, as Gorion predicted. All that remains is to determine motive.~

@17480 = ~But you could tell me so much, about Gorion and myself alike. Please, stay a while.~
@17481 = ~Thank goodness. Does that mean I shall be spared any more of your chatter?~
@17482 = ~Then I shall be on my way.~
@17483 = ~I fear I cannot. Self-discovery is best left to the self, and all thy questions will be answered in time. I will offer a small tidbit of information, though thou hast likely heard the same from another source already. The bandits that thou dost seek make a habit of traveling in the northeast. A search in that direction will no doubt yield fruitful results. With this, I shall take my leave.~
@17484 = ~It is a questionable mind that disregards a friendly voice, regardless of how nebulous the advice. Nevertheless, I shall say my peace in plain words and leave. The bandits that thou dost seek make a habit of traveling in the northeast. Fare thee well.~
@17485 = ~As it should be. Thou've quite the journey ahead of thee. I do have one bit of information to impart, though 'tis likely old news for thee. The bandits that thou dost seek make a habit of traveling in the northeast. With this, I shall take my leave.~
@17486 = ~That certainly seems to be the case. Thine actions are a testament to charity and free will, whether intentional or not. But enough of my ramblings. Thou've a long journey ahead of thee, and I will not have my meanderings delay thee. I will impart one piece of information before I go, though 'tis hardly a surprise, I am sure. The bandits that thou dost seek make a habit of traveling in the northeast. With this, I shall take my leave.~
@17487 = ~Thou've certainly taken it upon thyself to straddle the morality fence, but I cannot truly fault the results. I shall leave the future to thy discretion, and we shall see what happens. I do have one piece of information for thee before I go, though 'tis hardly a surprise, I am sure. The bandits that thou dost seek make a habit of traveling in the northeast. With this, I shall take my leave.~
@17488 = ~I am unsure, however, whether the distasteful road that thou've chosen is the result of a sadistic humor, or just the path of least resistance. If thou must indulge thy predatory instincts, at least be sure that they do not take total control. This would be especially dangerous for thee. I will impart one piece of information before I go, though 'tis hardly a surprise, I am sure. The bandits that thou dost seek make a habit of traveling in the northeast. With this, I shall take my leave.~
@17489 = ~This plate mail has been expertly crafted for you by Taerom Fuiruim of Beregost. Sheathed in the chitinous scales of the ankheg, it provides a greater degree of protection than traditional plate mail and is not susceptible to rust. As any world-weary adventurer will tell you, however, the most appreciated aspect of ankheg mail is its light weight and low encumbrance. Monsters come and go but fatigue is a constant enemy.

@17494 = ~Well... deranged it is then. I shall leave thee, if that is what thou dost wish. Heed my parting words however, and treat strangers with a touch more respect.

My, but I have wasted too much of thy time and said too much already. I shall take my leave and wish thee all the best.~

I shall trouble thee no more, as thou art more than capable of the task at hand. North is the Friendly Arm Inn, where I am certain thou shalt find trustworthy friends awaiting. I have said too much and taken too much time from thee. Fare thee well.~
@17499 = ~Another name for natrolite in the Realms; its slender, colorless crystals yield tiny faceted gems used often in veils and robes to capture the effect of beads of water glistening upon the material.~
@17500 = ~Aquamarine is a hard, transparent form of beryl, blue-green in color. These sought-after gems are found primarily in the barbarian tribes that roam the northern tundra.~
@17501 = ~Garnet is a general class of crystals ranging from deep red to violet in color. A typical cut for this rare isometric gem is 12 to 24 sides, with the very rare 36 sides being known from time to time. It is rumored that a 48-sided garnet exists although none have ever been able to track down its location.~
@17502 = ~Lynx Eye is a specific type of labradorite (a feldspar gemstone). Labradorite as a class of stones is pale to dark gray and has patches of colored reflections. This "flash" is most commonly blue but can be of all shades. "Green flash" labradorite is called lynx eye in the Realms.~
@17503 = ~Sunstone is a feldspar gem, closely related to moonstone, and more properly known as oligoclase. Sunstone can be colorless or faintly greenish and of facet grade, but most common by far is its softer (cabochon) variety. This yields gemstones that have bright red or orange spangles (minute crystals) suspended in a nearly colorless background in a parallel fashion, giving the whole a rich golden or reddish-brown color.~
@17504 = ~Turquoise is an opaque aqua stone with darker mottling, and is found in the more arid reaches of the Realms. Horsemen will often place a sliver of this stone in a horse's harness as a sign of good luck.~
@17505 = ~Fire Agate is the name given to chalcedony which contains thin lines of iridescent goethite. When properly cut, the iridescence displays red, brown, gold, and green hues, and the finest specimens are partly translucent.~
@17506 = ~Bloodstone is a dark greenish gray variety of quartz flecked with red crystal impurities. Ninety percent of the bloodstones in the Realms come from the Galena Mountains in Damara, and most of those from a single mine in Bloodstone Pass. The border pass is heavily fortified and guarded as bloodstones are the chief export for this region.~

@17510 = ~Horn Coral, which is also called night coral, is a deep black coral, similar to angel's skin save for its solid color. It is incredibly difficult to work with, and is used in jewelry as a polished twig or branch of material, or is cut cabochon.~
@17511 = ~Jasper is an opaque quartz found in reds, browns, and blacks. Very rare specimens are blue or have bands of blue against the other colors. Jasper can be crushed and used in making potions and magical devices which protect against poison.~
@17512 = ~This scroll is cursed. It would be unwise to read it, as the effects could prove fatal.~
@17513 = ~Iol is actually short for Iolite (cordierite), although a common nickname is "violet stone" even though its overall hue is usually blue. Iols are usually cut into faceted gems to best display the stone's color change as it is viewed from different directions. Small, cut iols can be clear, but larger specimens usually contain silky inclusions of another substance such as hematite crystals, which give the same rich golden flash of color as in sunstones.~
@17514 = ~Moonstone is an opaque, white feldspar gem polished to a bluish sheen. Old legends say that the sight of a moonstone would cause a lycanthrope to revert to his animal form. Whether or not this is true is unknown as anyone close enough to find out apparently hasn't lived to tell the tale. However moonstones have been used in spells that effect this particular curse.~

@17520 = ~Pearls consist of layers of aragonite agonizingly formed around a bit of grit or other irritant inside oysters and other mollusks. The resulting pearl has a rich, deep luster. Most of the pearls in the Realms are white, however there are varieties that are much more rare such as rainbow and black.~
@17521 = ~These rooms are of excellent quality at a somewhat reasonable price, and a definite luxury for those accustomed to sleeping under an open sky. None but the most pampered dandy would have complaints with these accommodations.~

@17668 = ~Shortbows were the first to be developed, although they were not called such. This is more of a default term that refers to anything which is not a longbow. Shortbow staves are about five feet long on the average. As the years passed, attempts were made to increase bow ranges. Bows were either given longer staves or flexibility was increased with no change to the length. The former resulted in what is now called the longbow.

@17688 = ~What's been the trouble at your mine site, lady?~
@17689 = ~Nice speaking to you lady, but we're in a hurry.~
@17690 = ~There's something evil in the mines, I tell ya. Several girls here in town have lost good husbands to that evil place, yet they keep sending new men to work there. I don't know what's going on, but I think it'd be really good if the bunch of you went down and took a look see.~
@17691 = ~Fine then, you adventurin' types are always so impatient.~
@17692 = ~We be proud citizens of Amn, here, not pussyfoots like you northerners...~
@17693 = ~I recognize you! Yer those adventurers who've been cleaning up on all the bandits, ain't ya. The leader of yer bunch is named <CHARNAME>. Why are ya up here at the Gate. Are ya restocking, or 'ave ya come 'cause there's evil to fight in town?~
@17694 = ~Amn? I thought this town was called Nashkel...~
@17695 = ~Watch your tongue or you'll soon be eating it.~
@17696 = ~We're just here to stock up on adventuring equipment. Would you know a good place we could do that?~

@17698 = ~There's a lot of stores about that sell equipment and weapons, I'm sure you'll find one soon enough. Oh! It's so exciting to meet some real live adventurers. Bye, bye <CHARNAME>.~
@17699 = ~I heard some weird stuff about the merchant consortiums in town. Both the Seven Suns and Merchants' league have been acting real strange as of late. Then there's that new Iron Throne that just moved in. They took over that huge abandoned tower in the west side of town. Well, that's all I really know. It was nice meeting some real adventurers. Bye now.~
@17700 = ~You've lived a sheltered life if you've never heard of the great trading nation of Amn. Nashkel, here, marks its northernmost boundary, though that may change before too long. Mark my words, there'll be Amnian soldiers lining the streets of Beregost by winter if those devils from Baldur's Gate don't stop sabotaging our iron...~
@17701 = ~Pleasant day to you all. My, my, you all look rather handsome decked out in your adventuring garb. That's what you are isn't it, adventurers? Well, I don't know what you're doing in our little town, from what I hear, the real excitement's happening down in Nashkel.~
@17702 = ~You heard me, pussyfoot... If you don't like it, take your troubles to the guards. This is Amnian law yer under, now.~
@17703 = ~What's been going on down in Nashkel?~
@17704 = ~Where we go, excitement follows.~
@17705 = ~Why, aren't you the most arrogant people I've come across in a long time. I guess it don't matter, your type's always been that way.~
@17706 = ~Please, unless you're here to do something about that wretched mine, leave me be. I lost my brother to its maw and now they've sent my only son into its depths. Please, have the grace to let a common woman mourn.~
@17707 = ~From what I've heard, there's some sort of trouble happening at the mines south east of there.~
@17708 = ~I care little about your personal life, woman. Bother me no more.~
@17709 = ~Excuse me, but I think I recognize you from some descriptions I've been given. Is your name <CHARNAME>?~
@17710 = ~I have heard much about the terrors of this mine. Tell me where it is that I might cleanse it and thereby breathe new hope into your fading heart.~
@17711 = ~Yes, that would be my name.~
@17712 = ~I think you've confused me with someone else.~
@17713 = ~Oh, sorry about that.~
@17714 = ~Well I think you should know that there's been a lot of people asking about you. There were a man and woman who were asking about someone named <CHARNAME>, and then there was this spooky fellow who was doing the same. A few days ago there was a big man who was looking for someone with your name. I don't know why yer so popular, but I'd watch it; some of these people didn't look too sociable.~
@17715 = ~They say that there be monsters that roam the earth's depths... Well fie on them, for I say they have already broken free from their infernal chains to stand before me now! Go ahead, rend my flesh, you monsters, for you have already left my life in tatters!~
@17716 = ~Hey there fella. Yer some kinda adventurers aren't ya. Well I've heard that commander Scar's been on the lookout for some hardy folk. Won't say why he needs more mercenaries, but then that's Flaming Fist business.~
@17717 = ~Heroes are made of strength and courage such as this. The mines lie south east, beyond the fairgrounds. Now please, make haste and save the men of this fair town while they yet live.~
@17718 = ~Thanks for the pointer.~
@17719 = ~Who is this "Commander Scar"?~
@17720 = ~No problem, have yourself a good time now.~
@17721 = ~Scar? He's the second in command of the Flaming Fist, the right hand man of Duke Eltan. A good soldier that one, always on the lookout to keep the city a safe place. You look like adventurers. Maybe you should go see him.~
@17722 = ~Good day to you. So have you heard of all the trouble brewing in the south? Awww, you probably don't care, you don't look like the political type.~
@17723 = ~I think you've misjudged us, we're as interested in politics as the next guy. So what's this trouble you were just talking about?~
@17724 = ~You're right, we don't give a damn about any politics.~
@17725 = ~Well, I guess that's yer choice, eh? See ya.~
@17726 = ~Why, nothing bad could ever happen in such a beautiful city!~
@17727 = ~The Undercellar? What happens there? Anything to do with the folks from the Iron Throne?~
@17728 = ~Aye, well, the Gate, she'll learn ya soon enough. Ain't nothing or no one ever comes to this city without gettin' their souls a little blacker afore they go...~
@17729 = ~Well from what I've heard, there's some tension between the nation of Amn and the city of Baldur's Gate. I've heard that the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate think that Amn's behind all of the iron troubles along the coast. Some people have even gone as far to say that Amn might be preparing to invade. I think it's just the usual rumor-mongering that goes on from time to time, but then, you never know.~
@17730 = ~Mayhaps it does, but I wouldn't know. That place takes all types: the filthy rich and the dirty poor, the brightest of rogues and the most tarnished of holy men... Aye, for there walk the ladies of the night and all souls sink 'fore their kisses, like moths to the light. Now go, it is best not to linger on such thoughts.~
@17731 = ~Hey there, newcomer. You'll do fine here at the Friendly Arm, as long as you don't get on the bad side of Bentley and Gellana. Just a friendly bit of advice fer the bunch of you.~
@17732 = ~Alas, the rot's got poor Ghorak. I doubt he'll be with us much longer.~
@17733 = ~We don't intend to get on anyone's bad side.~
@17734 = ~Who are these people, Bentley and Gellana?~
@17735 = ~That's good fella, I'm glad yer not the troublemaking kind that mercenaries usually turn out to be.~
@17736 = ~Gellana and Bentley are husband and wife. They've run the Friendly Arm for as long as anyone can remember. Bentley likes to tend the bar in the inn, while his wife Gellana is the high priestess at the temple to Garl Glittergold. They're real good people.~
@17737 = ~The rot? Why, that's horrible...~
@17738 = ~Who's Ghorak? I don't recognize the name.~
@17739 = ~Ay, it is a horror indeed and e'en more so in one who once shone so brightly. He was one of Tymora's own, and, alongside his brother Kereph, the kindest soul. But then ill befell him... It is not like Lady Luck to abandon and persecute her faithful so.~
@17740 = ~He was a fixture in this city, sharp of wit and fair of face... Indeed I loved him once, we all did! Ghorak and his brother Kereph. We were like giggling girls scattering ourselves at their feet and they treated each of us with such respect and dignity. Lady Luck loved them too, it seemed, but she is fickle and cruel mistress. Kereph is long dead, you see, and Ghorak bears the plague. Aye, like a spurned lover, Tymora turns her loves away that she might draw them closer in the end.~
@17741 = ~Hey, aren't you <CHARNAME>! You're the one who saved the mine, killed all those dog men. You must be real brave to have done what you did. Wow, real heroes, here in Nashkel.~
@17742 = ~Hey, ain't you the fellas that just finished clearing out them mines. I think one of yer names was <CHARNAME>? Well, I gotta thank you. What you done has saved our community.~
@17743 = ~I don't like the looks of it. What with the iron shortage and the bandits round about, no one seems to pass through the Friendly Arm anymore 'cept in gangs and armed to the teeth like yourself...~
@17744 = ~Hey ain't you the mercenaries who saved the mines of Nashkel? Well good fer you, we need more people like you. I suppose you're going to give those bandits some trouble now? Good for you if you are. You'll make a lot of people happy, you will.~
@17745 = ~A right evil man, that Bassilus! He don't just kill people; he makes them into zombies and pretends they're his family. What would make a man do that, exceptin' evil?~
@17746 = ~A more puzzling thing I've never heard. I was left for dead by the raiders, and a stranger healed me. Had the worst visage I ever hope to lay eyes on, but his bearing I cannot question.~
@17747 = ~Have you heard about those adventurers from Nashkel? They killed a thousand kobolds, they did. They must have been twenty feet tall, at least. Ehhh, I know that's ridiculous, but stories get so much better each time they are told.~
@17748 = ~Aye, I like it no more than you. The treacherous roads have near cost me my life. Which routes are still clear, do you know?~
@17749 = ~You look a lot like those mercenaries from down south I've been hearing about. Brave work, battlin' those dog men and such. I guess Amn wasn't faking the trouble in the mines after all. They could've staged the whole thing though. I wouldn't put it past them.~
@17750 = ~There should have been a merchant caravan through here just yesterday. Odd that they have not arrived yet. They were supposed to bring iron ore down from the north. I bet they suffered the same fate as all the rest.~
@17751 = ~You're the adventurers who killed all them monsters at Nashkel, aren't you? You must be really brave. If we had more like you we'd never have to worry about things like this again.~
@17752 = ~Where is all this trouble coming from?~
@17753 = ~I've merchant relatives that routinely make the trip along the Coast Way road. They have said that the route they travel is normally bustling. Surely this could be a veritable floodgate of iron if the need were great.~
@17754 = ~Word around here is that the west road is the safest, at least for now. The road south to Beregost is dangerous but there's still been some traffic. Further south to Nashkel is supposed to be some rough traveling. No more caravans are making it through from the iron mine down there but it's probably just as well. Their iron's been weak as tin of late. As for the road north, well... we haven't had a shipment from Baldur's Gate for more than a month. For all we know, it's been sacked and burnt.~
@17755 = ~Amn, if you ask me. The rotten iron they've been sending out of Nashkel's just salt for the wounds... They'll starve us of metal all summer and probably attack Beregost before winter sets. Gods only know if the Dukes in Baldur's Gate will defend us this time.~
@17756 = ~Used to be a bandit, I was. More money there than in the mines at Nashkel, that's fer sure. Probably less danger, too, from the sounds of it.~
@17757 = ~You were a bandit, were you?~
@17758 = ~What's so dangerous about the Nashkel mines?~
@17759 = ~That I was and I ain't afraid to say it, neither. But those bandits out there now, they're different, I tell ya. They've got a mean streak in 'em and their minds set on taking over the whole area... Most of my old pals have gone missin' and I don't like it one bit. That's why I'm holed up, here. I've been good to Bentley and Gellana in the past so now it's their turn to look after me.~
@17760 = ~Know what I heard? I heard that some brave souls went through the mines and gave the beasties in there a big ol' whuppin! I sure hope it's true!~
@17761 = ~It is true indeed, for it was I, <CHARNAME>, that did it!~
@17762 = ~You and everyone else. I've already met three others that claimed the deed as their own, so you'd best get in line. As if heroes like that would be such braggarts. Sheesh.~
@17763 = ~Well, if you believed every tale you heard, you'd have to say the King of the Nine Hells, himself, were down at the bottom of it, smoking a pipe and making the place comfortable... To be honest, I don't know what's down there. All I know is that a lot of the folks who work in that infernal place don't ever make it back up to the surface.~
@17764 = ~If it is true, that pretty much solves all your problems, doesn't it?~
@17765 = ~Not by a long shot. Don't matter if we got ore when bandits control the roads north. Besides, everyone still thinks Amn is behind it all. If they are, it means war isn't far off. No more troubles? I wish.~
@17766 = ~It's a good day for a change. The mines have been purged and that means back to work for a lot of folks.~
@17767 = ~~
@17768 = ~Aye, the world is falling apart around us and here before me lie a band of groveling adventurers, preying on my every word to hear rumors of the latest dungeon fad...~
@17769 = ~locator feedback~
@17770 = ~Sorry to bother Your Highness...~
@17771 = ~Dungeons...?~
@17772 = ~Stuff your sarcasm and get out of here, lout.~
@17773 = ~You're pathetic... Okay, I'll rattle it off for you like I did for the last adventurer and the one before that. I have no doubt you'll share their fate. Let's see, there are the ruins of an old mage school to the southeast. Traps, dead things that try to kill you, you know the schtick... Then there's the Firewine Bridge: ghosts, winding narrow passageways, some poetry, blah, blah, blah... Honestly, I can't think of a life more tedious than that of an adventurer. Personally, I get far more out of wandering around aimlessly and scratching my arse like this.~
@17774 = ~Good news for all concerned. Any word on those responsible?~
@17775 = ~You mean the heroes? Why sure! <CHARNAME> was the name I heard. Don't know if it's true or not though. The story gets bigger with each telling. By the time I heard it, the heroes were ten feet tall and used treetrunks for clubs.~
@17776 = ~Things will be getting back to normal then?~
@17777 = ~Well, it may be better, but we're a long way from normal. The mine may be up and running, but it will be a long while before the effect reaches the whole of the region. Bandits still hold the roads to the north, so merchants aren't going anywhere, whether they've wares to sell or not.~
@17778 = ~character sounds~
@17779 = ~Oh, I wish I could be an adventurer like you rather than a simple scullery maid like me. My sister and I would hold off a thousand Amnian soldiers, standing back to back, our arms tiring as twilight falls and mists begin to rise from the moonlit lake...~
@17780 = ~Ah, the choice 'tween scullery and skullduggery, then, is it? Well, a woman's arms are as strong as a man's and your courage seems stronger yet. You are welcome to join us and your sister, too, should she be willing.~
@17781 = ~I'm afraid it often lacks the romance with which you have imbued it. Kill a single Amnian soldier and all of Amn is after you. Stand back to back and your flanks are unprotected. Those mists that rise from your moonlit lake are pretty to behold but they bring rust with them and the chill of damp steel against your flesh...~
@17782 = ~You... you look familiar for some reason. Kinda like the group that stormed the mine. Leastwise you look like the description my brother Emerson gave. Ah heck, even if it's not you, I just feel like thanking someone. Good work down there!~
@17783 = ~A tempting offer but I guess I should wait for more peaceful times. There's plenty of time to dream and think of pretty pictures when scrubbing floors. Laid in a cold and shallow grave, I doubt I'd have the luxury.~
@17784 = ~Your thanks are welcome, though perhaps a reward might say it better.~
@17785 = ~Well you've got some nerve! Sure you may have helped the town, but it's not like everything is wonderful now. I'll be back to work tomorrow, but it won't matter. As long as everyone thinks Amn was behind all of this, Nashkel could be on the frontline of a war. You try and sleep at night when such as this is going on!~
@17786 = ~You've got some nerve wrecking a woman's pretty illusions like that. In times of trouble they're all we have. And without them, our children will grow up to be petty bureaucrats and mindless cogs in some Gondish machine, all harsh and bitter, never realizing that a world of wonder is still out there, somewhere just beyond their walled horizon!~
@17787 = ~It was my great pleasure to help you, the common man. I could not stand by while such villainy as this was allowed to pass!~
@17788 = ~No wonder you went down those mines. You're a complete loon. Well, as long as the job is done, I suppose it doesn't matter if your helm is on too tight. Hey, how about pointing your righteous wrath at the brigands to the north? Iron isn't going to be getting through to most of the region until the trade routes are clear.~
@17789 = ~I only did what was necessary. It could have been anyone.~
@17790 = ~Nay, it couldn't have been anyone. People were scared, most still are. Don't get me wrong, everyone is grateful. It's just that things aren't going to change much. Rumors still talk of Amnian plots and Zhentarim agents, and iron is still going to be scarce for a while. At least until the trade routes are cleared of bandits, anyway,~
@17791 = ~Studded Leather Armor +2: "Missile Attraction"~
@17792 = ~It's back to work soon enough for most of us now. Good news, but I hear who organized the whole plot is still a mystery. Until they know for sure, the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate aren't going to let up pressure on Amn.~
@17793 = ~Good luck on your travels.~
@17794 = ~Wait! Perhaps it would be better if we traveled together.~
@17795 = ~It's wonderful that the mines are going to be opening again. Glad to get the hubby out of the house, I will be. He was practically going insane not being able to work. I suppose now all we have to worry about is... well... bandits hijacking all our merchant caravans.~
@17796 = ~Rezdan~
@17797 = ~Rezdan~
@17798 = ~But having the mines open will surely relieve some of the tensions in the area, won't it?~

@17801 = ~Kysus~
@17802 = ~Drasus~
@17803 = ~Oh certainly! It's just that since the bandits attack all merchant caravans, no one dares transport goods. They are apparently extra vicious if you are dealing in iron. We can produce it, but no one will dare the roads.~

@17805 = ~Drasus~
@17806 = ~Genthore~
@17807 = ~Well, everyone would probably relax a bit more if they knew who was behind all these plots. With all the talk of Amnian agents, Zhentish spies, bandit raids, and Baldur's Gate politics, nobody knows who to trust anymore.~
@17808 = ~Genthore~
@17809 = ~Sorry, but I don't have time for talkin'. The mine may be opening, but my life is no easier. Bandits raid every caravan we send out of town, so it don't matter if we have iron. Nobody else is going to be getting any.~
@17810 = ~So you're the high and mighty heroes who saved the Nashkel mine, eh? Pardon me if I don't jump for joy, but the only thing your efforts got me was a chance to retrieve my husband's body. I should be grateful for that, I suppose, but I don't feel too much like celebrating right now.~

Seems like the mines and the bandits is linked somehow. Maybe Amn is behind 'em both or something. I don't know, but something should be done.~
@17835 = ~Well, I did hear about them. Supposedly real brave, and damn good looking too.~

@17846 = ~Why yes, that would indeed be us. Thank you for noticing.~
@17847 = ~Maybe, maybe not. If we were them, perhaps we'd want to keep a low profile.~
@17848 = ~Oh, how could I not? Saviors you are! Nashkel will recover soon enough, and then the rest of the area will follow. Hey, THAT must be what you are doing here! You've come to get rid of the bandits! Of course that must be it! You'll be scouting around just north to find and defeat those nasty brigands! I should have known heroes such as yourselves wouldn't be just wandering aimlessly, no sir!~
@17849 = ~Lobar~
@17850 = ~Oh? OH! Of COURSE, how foolish of me! You'll be keeping quiet, so as to catch the bandits in the area by surprise! Brilliant! That means you'll be heading north to the last ambush sites. Don't worry, I won't tell a SOUL! Well, maybe Shallie. She'll never believe I met you. Oh, and maybe Dilben and Wadsworth too. I'll HAVE to tell them, just to show them up. Don't you worry though. Not a soul other than them!~
@17851 = ~I heard rumors that the mine in Nashkel has produced its first ore in quite some time. It don't mean a thing though. It'll be weeks before even an ounce gets through to us, what with bandits everywhere. They're exceptionally bad to the north, though.~
@17852 = ~This potion confers invisibility similar to the second-level wizard spell of the same name. Actions involving combat cause termination of the invisible state. Barring combat, the effects will last for 12 hours.~

@17855 = ~Once exposed to air, this oil will immediately burst into flame, inflicting 5D6 points of damage (save vs. breath for half) to all within the immediate area around the potion. It can be hurled up to around 40', at which point it hits the ground and immediately explodes into a ball of fire.~
@17856 = ~This oil increases the movement and combat capabilities of the imbiber by 100%. Thus, a movement rate of 9, becomes 18, and a character normally able to attack once in a round attacks twice. This does not reduce spellcasting time however. The duration of the effect is 5 turns.~

@17861 = ~This potion will maintain clarity and order from encroaching chaos and insanity.

@17868 = ~This powerful elixir imbues the drinker with 50% resistance to all forms of magical damage. The effect lasts for 3 turns, making this potion slightly more battle-specific.

@17884 = ~I am here to meet some friends.~
@17885 = ~I'm not your friend and my business is my own.~
@17886 = ~I see, I see. Pardon my being too forward, but you've the bearing of someone I've been looking for. About your height, they were. Same style of dress, or thereabouts. I daresay, you seem to be the spitting image of them. Might you have traveled from Candlekeep, by any chance?~
@17887 = ~You have been cursed with Lethargy.~
@17888 = ~Actually yes! I was there until quite recently.~
@17889 = ~I may have visited there on occasion. What of it?~
@17890 = ~Candlekeep? Never heard of it.~
@17891 = ~Well that just about clinches it then. By any wild stretch of the imagination would your name happen to be <CHARNAME>?~
@17892 = ~Why yes, good sir, that is my name. It would seem that I am the one you have been looking for.~
@17893 = ~Never heard that name before in my life. Sorry.~
@17894 = ~Yes, yes it would. In that case, don't move. I have something for you.~
@17895 = ~Really? I would beg to differ. You fit the description, so I think it would be safe to assume you are the one I seek. Don't move. I have something for you.~
@17896 = ~Oh, you must be whom I am to meet then. I will take you to your friends, but first I should be sure you are the correct person. Is your name <CHARNAME>?~
@17897 = ~Why, Yes it is.~
@17898 = ~Sorry, but no. I don't think you're the person I'm supposed to meet.~
@17899 = ~Perfect. You are indeed the person I seek. Hold still a moment, won't you?~
@17900 = ~How rude. No really, that is utterly rude of you. I'd teach you a lesson about manners, but that implies that you are going to live. If I weren't going to anyway, I'd kill you just for being so uppity.~
@17901 = ~Oh, nothing really. I'm just looking for someone from that region. Would your name be <CHARNAME> by any chance?~
@17902 = ~Why, Yes it is.~
@17903 = ~Never heard that name before in my life. Sorry.~

@17918 = ~Who I am is unimportant, though my name is Neira. What I am, is a hunter of bounties, and on your head is a lovely little sum. Does this satisfy your request? I thought it wouldn't. No matter.~

@17920 = ~To put it as succinctly as possible, no.~
@17921 = ~Sorry chum, but I can't stop to chat. There's been another caravan raided northeast of Beregost and I must report of these dire straits to the Grand Dukes. A messenger's work is never done.~

@17925 = ~You had best step aside, if you know what's good for you!~
@17926 = ~You want to know what I always say? "Always kill the mouthy one," that's what I always say.~
@17927 = ~I don't suppose you would care to talk this over? There's no need for bloodshed.~
@17928 = ~I know exactly what is good for me! It is good for us to kill you and get paid a large sum of gold! I would say that is good. My party members here think that is good. Those are the votes that count!~
@17929 = ~HAW! A good saying! I will use your head for a puppet and make it say it over and over while we drink large amounts of mead! Life is pretty good, you know?~
@17930 = ~No need for bloodshed? There's an incredible need for bloodshed! We've been looking forward to it all day! You fight very well, so we are here to stop you. You don't think they call us in to squash bugs, do you?~

Rieltar~
@17932 = ~No time, no time! On the run with info! Off to Amn to report of things most dire indeed! Bandit raids increasing, iron ore depleting, and everyone is up in arms about their lack of arms. No wonder relations are strained to the brink. On my way I am to AMN.~
@17933 = ~Speedy delivery, speedy delivery coming through. Must inform the Grand Dukes of the Nashkel mine liberation. They must be told iron supplies will return to normal once trade routes are reliable once again. Speedy delivery, coming through!~
@17934 = ~What was the purpose of this installation?~
@17935 = ~The mine? Um... I... I think they were going to try and look like the saviors of the day, riding in with their stores of iron to equip the troops, or something like that. With the bandit raids and the rumors about Amn, the Iron Throne figured that the Dukes of Baldur's Gate would think they needed arms and ore quickly in case of Amnian attack. They... they figured they could get exorbitant prices, or better yet, sanctions against competitors and an easing of trade laws for themselves only. A quick way to install themselves as an underground power on the coast. That's all I know about it, I swear!~
@17936 = ~Hthsss! You startled me, child.~
@17937 = ~What are you doing to that cat?~
@17938 = ~Those before us were fools, as you are. Those before us were weak, as you are. Those before us were not Zhalimar, or Gardush, or Naaman, or Diyab, or Aasim, or Alai. Those before us are dead, as you will be. So it has been decreed; so it shall be done. So orders Sarevok!~
@17939 = ~You have breached an inner circle, fool. There are no hired lackeys for you to bribe here, no mercenaries that slather at the sound of coins. We are servants of Sarevok and Sarevok alone, selected by hand to protect his destiny. You... are an insect. You... will be crushed! His will... be done!~
@17940 = ~This is an exit of sorts, and you will indeed be leaving. I would hazard a guess that the situation shall be a bit more permanent than you would have liked. Long ago you crossed the line that would have allowed for your survival. So it has been ordained; so it shall come to pass. So commands Sarevok!~
@17941 = ~I have a task for you and those you have selected. You, the first of the faithful, are to stand ground in my stead. Be assured that I would not belittle your devotion with simple guard duty. This chore is of particular interest to me, and thus, to you. <CHARNAME> has become as a thorn in my side. I wish it removed. Do so, and you shall please me greatly. Such is your charge. Do not fail in this.

Sarevok~
@17942 = ~It's a shame my line of work doesn't allow for leisurely chats, but it's an important job. Must run the message through, rain or shine or gibberling. Amn grows weary of invasion accusations, and is demanding restitution from the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. This will not sit well indeed! Make way!~
@17943 = ~Must get through to Amn, I must! Baldur's Gate demands a stop to the raids of its merchant caravans. I deliver messages quick and true, but when last I heard, Amn was requesting the same of Baldur's Gate! Someone is certainly confused somewhere, but it's not my business to think. Must run!~
@17944 = ~Must dash to Beregost, I must! Governor Kelddath must be told of the extra troops being sent his way! Beregost is to be garrisoned in case of Amnian attack, though Amn has denied such intent. Of course they would deny it, the snakes! Make way for the messenger!~
@17945 = ~Heh? Who? Get outta my yard you hooligans! Kinda hard to be a hermit when people keep pestering for hints about the nature of existence. Read a book people! Portalbendarwinden does so command.~
@17946 = ~~
@17947 = ~Your... yard? No, wait! Please, I was hoping to speak with you. Has your isolation given you any insights I might benefit from?~
@17948 = ~Don't speak to me of such nonsense, old fool. Have you anything useful for me? Information or items perhaps?~
@17949 = ~My apologies at disturbing your peace. No doubt you are so isolated because you wish to remain alone.~
@17950 = ~Ehhh... insights? Um... never take raisins from rabbits, never spit in a man's face unless his mustache is on fire, and don't take any wooden knickers unless you've a good supply of salve.~
@17951 = ~This potion acts like the spell Free Action when consumed. The drinker becomes completely immune to any effects which hinder action or movement whether it is magical in origin or not. The duration of the potion is 10 turns.~
@17952 = ~By drinking the potion of firebreath, it magically transforms the throat so that it is capable of a giant breath of fire spewing forth in an arc. The effect does 6D10 damage to the target with a save vs. breath weapon for half.~
@17953 = ~Once consumed, this potion will cause a surge of energy to travel through the body raising the drinker's constitution to 18. This provides all the bonuses of having a high constitution such as hit points for the duration of the effect, which is 15 turns.~
@17954 = ~I... see. Thanks for your time but I'll be going now... quickly.~
@17955 = ~"That" was all you have to offer? Quite the letdown after the length of time it took to find you.~
@17956 = ~Okay, I've just about had my FILL of riddle asking, quest assigning, insult throwing, pun hurling, hostage taking, iron mongering, smart-arsed fools, freaks, and felons that continually test my will, mettle, strength, intelligence, and most of all, patience! If you've got a straight answer ANYWHERE in that bent little head of yours, I want to hear it pretty damn quick or I'm going to take a large blunt object roughly the size of Elminster AND his hat, and stuff it lengthwise into a crevice of your being so seldom seen that even the denizens of the Nine Hells themselves wouldn't touch it with a twenty-foot rusty halberd! Have I MADE myself perfectly CLEAR?!~
@17957 = ~I've heard lots of talk about war; it's all my husband and his loudmouth friends can talk about. I don't believe it for one second! Amn and Baldur's Gate have always been at peace, and I think it'll stay that way.~
@17958 = ~Those new Iron Throne people scare me. Ever since they moved into the west tower, things have gotten worse for us little folk. I know it's kinda paranoid to blame the Throne for all the bandits and the iron thing, but none of that happened until they showed up.~
@17959 = ~Hello there! You're adventurers aren't you. You must be real brave to have to fight monsters and such. Ummmm... you know if any of you are wantin' to have a good time, I know a place; it's called the Splurging Sturgeon and it's located in the north east of town.~
@17960 = ~I'm sorry to be so intrusive, but aren't you those adventurers who cleared out the monsters at the mines of Nashkel. I just have to say how pleasant it is to see people who are willing to risk their lives to help others.~
@17961 = ~Hmm? Oh yes, that and my disturbing personal habits. As well, people don't mind advice when they're looking for it, but having someone around continually spouting proverbs and truisms really puts a damper on the picnic. It's worse than when the ants steal the cheese, if you know what I mean? Eh? EH?! Wow, you're really hard to look at.~
@17962 = ~Adventurers! Don't you go telling any children your fanciful stories about monsters and swashbuckling. All you do is get the wrong idea in their heads.~
@17963 = ~If I had wished comments about my appearance I would have asked for them. Bah! I have no time to waste on such as you.~
@17964 = ~Damn it all! You go through a hard days work, just so you can see some fancy-pantsy adventurers strolling down the streets like they own the city. Why don't ya get a real job, ya flakes.~
@17965 = ~Captain Brage went missing a few days ago. Ma and Pa told me that he's crazy. Sometimes at night I'm pretty sure that he's roaming around the woods just outside our house but I'm too afraid to go outside.~
@17966 = ~I have to tell ya, keep away from anybody claiming to be a member of the Iron Throne trading cartel. They're bad folk, and not to be trusted.~
@17967 = ~I get you. Matter of fact and straight to business. I like that. No... no, "like" is the wrong word. "Hate" is more the feeling I was trying to capture in that phrase. I rather think I've nothing to say to you, now please leave and turn your aura down when you go. You are intensely hard to look at.~
@17968 = ~Hey ain't you those heroes from down south. You guys did real good, wupping those bandits asses. I always wanted to be an adventurer, but ya know how things work out. Good luck to all of ya!~
@17969 = ~What? What about my aura? Please, tell me what you see.~
@17970 = ~Ahh, take your mumbo-jumbo and stuff it someplace warm and wet.~
@17971 = ~Wow. You guys are real adventurers. Ain't too often that country girls like myself get to see a real 'venturer. It must be pretty excitin' to go to far off places and meet so many different people.~
@17972 = ~Oh I see! Now that I've something to say you're all "please what do you see," and "I'm sorry I trod on your begonias." Well I've better things to do. Suffice to say that you are decidedly shiny on the inside, regardless of your dim exterior. I would imagine that you're not entirely normal, but I didn't need a third eye or fourth leg to tell you that. Now off with you, before I am forced to... well... probably flee.~
@17973 = ~You people must be crazy to travel the roads these days. With all the bandits about, you gotta be rather foolhardy to leave the safety of town.~
@17974 = ~I think my husband might take it the wrong way if he saw the bunch of you talking to me in the street. He's got a real nasty temper, and he's real jealous too. Sorry to be so rude, but it's for your own good.~
@17975 = ~Well... someone certainly woke up on the wrong side of the Realms this morning. So be it, I shall say my piece and nothing more. You have an exceptionally unstable aura because you are literally at odds with yourself. I have not seen your like before, but I get the feeling that is because your type does not survive exceptionally long. Your battles to come are both physical and otherworldly, but I cannot discern the outcome. Your coin is on its edge. If that means nothing to you, then I cannot help. Leave me now.~
@17976 = ~You new to town, eh? Well if I were you I'd just turn around and leave. Ever since the monsters started the killin' in our iron mines, this town's been cursed. Just a few weeks past, our guard commander lost his mind and slaughtered his family. No good to stay here, trust me.~
@17977 = ~This potion will protect the drinker from all forms of petrification including gaze attacks. The effect will last for 10 rounds or until dispelled.~
@17978 = ~If you've come to town looking for work, you might as well pack up and go back to whence you came. Our mines to the east are soon to be closed down. No one's willing to work there anymore, 'cept the foolhardy and the desperate. Something's down in those mines... something evil.~
@17979 = ~Hey there fella, looks like you and yer group are a traveling band. Well, if yer lookin' to have some fun, or maybe restock on your traveling equipment, the place to go is the fair. It's just east of town. The fair ain't too lively, with what's been going on in the mines, but you'll find what ya need.~
@17980 = ~What brings your band to our little town? Not much to see here, we're the pimple on Amn's buttocks. If you insist on staying, here's a little word of warning: people are real touchy, so don't go 'round stirring up any trouble.~
@17981 = ~If that is what you wish, then feel free to hit the ol' dusty trail. Regardless, I have places to see and people to do. Leave me.~
@17982 = ~I heard that there's a lot of money to be made in Nashkel. The people of the town are desperate fer mercenaries. From what I hear, their iron mines are infested with monsters, and since the mine is the town's main source of income... well they're rather eager to get things back to normal.~
@17983 = ~Red Potion~
@17984 = ~Close examination reveals this liquid to be very peculiar in nature. It could be a sorcerer's dream, but that would depend entirely on who you asked. After ingesting the mixture, the drinker becomes the weakest, most unwise, yet incredibly intelligent person to have ever lived, with an innate 50% magic resistance as well. The effects remain for an entire 24 hours, so think carefully before unplugging the cork.

@17988 = ~I hate this stupid town. Nothing ever happens around here. A person could die just from the boredom. What we need around here is a good war, that'll spice things up. Good for the economy.~
@17989 = ~My husband does a lot of traveling. He says that monsters as well as bandits are hitting caravans. Rarely are the denizens of the surrounding area so bold.~
@17990 = ~I hear they have the softest silks and rare textiles in Baldur's Gate. It must be quite the trading port to have such finery. You can purchase most anything there I have been told.~
@17991 = ~This is one of the oddest potions you have ever examined. Once drank, this mixture causes one's muscles to immediately bulge to completely inhuman proportions, titan like actually, while dexterity and constitution are both reduced essentially to that of a slug.

@17992 = ~Wait... I'm sorry, but you have misconstrued my meaning. A bit blunt I am at times, but I shall speak plain if you wish. I meant that your aura is hard to look at. It is exceptionally volatile. You are at odds with yourself in a most literal fashion. I've not seen another such as you, though I get the feeling that your type does not live exceptionally long. I would predict a violent end for you, but I can see nothing of your future. It would seem that your coin is on edge. Enough chatter, I have wasted too much of your time, and mine. Leave me.~
@17993 = ~Your insults are misplaced. I only wished to speak, and you could have simply said no. I will leave you.~
@17994 = ~I've never been satisfied with the dresses made by Elma Spitwrack. The workmanship is shoddy and the material is coarse. I've never understood why she is considered so highly by the fashion establishment in Waterdeep. I think that a blind goblin could make a better dress.~
@17995 = ~Most interesting... after combining Mandrake and Nightshade the world slows down and rabbits steal my pants. Lord Engles suggests that an Avatar is to blame but I think he's talking rot.~
@17996 = ~If you'll excuse me, I really find that I have no reason to speak with a mangy group of dirty adventurers. Go off somewhere and play your little sword and sorcery games, but please don't do it around me.~

@17998 = ~You'll reach the Hells before Krystin.~
@17999 = ~Inventory Is Full~
@18000 = ~Enable this option to run the game in full screen mode, or disable it to run in windowed mode.~
@18001 = ~When sprite mirroring is enabled, the computer draws a sprite backwards (left to right) when a character turns to face the opposite direction. This technique saves memory, since not all of the character's direction sprites need to be loaded.~
@18002 = ~That character is too far away.~

@18016 = ~These buttons control how often the party characters will say their command sounds. Choosing "always" plays a sound every time a character is given a command. Choosing "seldom" plays a sound only when the character is selected and given its initial command. Choosing "never" disables command sounds.~
@18017 = ~This slider controls the delay before a tool-tip appears over a control. The maximum value disables tool-tips.~
@18018 = ~This slider controls how fast the area scrolls in response to mouse movement.~
@18019 = ~This slider controls how fast the area scrolls in response to the keyboard shortcuts.~
@18020 = ~This slider controls the difficulty level to be used in combat. The middle setting is true AD&D. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THE GAME USING THE TRUE AD&D RULES, THEN DON'T TOUCH THIS SLIDER. If you move the slider to an easier setting, then you will receive proportionately less experience points. The reverse does not apply when you use a harder setting.~
@18021 = ~Enable this option if a character should always appear dithered when it is obscured by an object. If this setting is disabled, the character is only dithered when the mouse cursor is over it or its portrait. Otherwise, the character is not displayed at all.~
@18022 = ~Enable this option to hear environmental audio effects such as echoes in caves. This option requires a sound card compatible with the EAX standard.~
@18023 = ~Enable this option for gory combat animations.~
@18024 = ~This slider controls when the ellipsoid markers are rendered under creatures.
Minimum - picked creature
Low - picked creature or selected character

@18044 = ~This panel is used to choose the conditions under which the game should automatically pause.~
@18045 = ~Please keep your voice down, will you? It's hard enough getting the hang of this fish-wrangling business without you scaring them all away.~
@18046 = ~Fish-wrangling? I take it you've never done this before?~
@18047 = ~Bah! As if I care for your woes. I make noise as I wish.~
@18048 = ~My apologies. I'll leave you to your work.~
@18049 = ~Nay, I have not. Used to be a miner, I did. I've sunk to this to feed my family. Not that it's a bad way to make a living, mind you. I just prefer having a good solid pick in my hands and sweating while I work. There's too much standing about waiting for the fish to bite. Ah well, we do what we must.~
@18050 = ~If'n I weren't a gentleman I might have something to say to you about that. As it is, go and make your noise. Splash about if you will, and indulge your childish nature if you must. I hope you get a leech in your codpiece.~
@18051 = ~I thank you, though this is not my true calling. I much prefer the mines, but I also prefer remaining alive. It is simply not a safe time to be a man o' the deeps. Have to feed the family somehow though.~
@18052 = ~A hearty welcome to you! Come to test your mettle against the denizens of the waters have you? A fine profession it is, and I've not enjoyed myself so in ages, simply AGES!~
@18053 = ~You stay by the water in case the villagers come at you with torches, don't you.~
@18054 = ~Pardon me for noticing, but you seem a touch, oh how shall I put this, a touch loony.~
@18055 = ~Leave me be. Your demeanor practically makes me ill.~
@18056 = ~I fail to "catch" your meaning. Eh? "Catch"? Yeesh, quite the stoic bunch of prudes, aren't you? No matter, I shall put the brightest shine on the day that I can, regardless of how unappreciative the audience. Torlo appreciates my good humor, don't you Torlo? I say, DON'T YOU TORLO? A bit moody, that fellow.~
@18057 = ~You are entitled to your interpretation, though I prefer to think of myself as optimistic. I've been put out of work because of the iron shortage too, blah blah blah and all that rot. I have simply chosen to not let it get me down. So I'm out of the mine, so what? I'll fish for food, and look decidedly less pale at the end of the day because I got some sun for a change. Now if you don't mind, I've some SINGING to do!~
@18058 = ~Ooooo! A sourpuss, eh? Well best you be moving on then, because I won't be letting your foul mood darken my day. Sure there's trouble in the mines, bandits roaming the woods, and all manner of beastie munching on innocent travelers, but if you dwell on every little detail it's eventually going to drive you nuts. NUTS! I for one am not going to let that happen to me. No sir, not going to happen.~
@18059 = ~Leave me be. I'm pickin' fruit for mommy. Every little bit helps, she says, so I'm gonna help.~
@18060 = ~Do your parents know where you are?~
@18061 = ~Isn't it dangerous for you to be out here?~
@18062 = ~Little brat shouldn't be out in the woods alone. Go on, get!~
@18063 = ~Momma thinks I'm playin' at Betsie Finkle's house, but her grandma smells funny so I never go over there. I just told momma I was there so she wouldn't worry. I'll pick some fruit or berries or whatever, and momma can make pies to sell or something. I'm safe, cuz I'm small and quick.~
@18064 = ~Yeah, I s'pose. I'm fast though, and town is only a little ways away. I was chased by a gibberling once, but Bunky's dad is a guard and he smacked that grass monkey like it had never been hit before. They keep clear of town. Bandits don't go for kids much, neither. They only hit ya if you're packing ore to town. I gotta get back to pickin', okay?~
@18065 = ~Tough bunch o' jerks, huh? Think you can push me around just cuz you're big? Well when I'm growed up I'll smack you so hard you'll starve to death doing cartwheels! Just you wait!~
@18066 = ~Don't you be getting any closer or I'll have mom come and give you the belt!~
@18067 = ~Relax kid, I don't want to hurt you.~
@18068 = ~Ahh, beat it child. I've got no time for your whining.~
@18069 = ~As you would have it. I did not want to frighten you.~
@18070 = ~Oh sure! That's what that other group of bandits said, and then they went and attacked a caravan I just saw leave. They were a bunch of liars, probably just like you. Get lost!~
@18071 = ~Big dummies. If my buddy Albert were here he'd turn you inside out or somethin'. His mom lets him go wherever he wants, cuz he's tough. He'd smack you good!~
@18072 = ~Maybe you're not so mean, but that don't mean nothing! Them other bandits didn't seem mean, until they attacked old man Brill. Stupid bandits and their stupid iron. Leave me!~
@18073 = ~Well, don't you just add to the local color. Quite the smashing bit of dress you wear there. I'll have to look into such sundries when I next attend one of Lord Ribald's full dress costume affairs. I'd be the talk of Neverwinter, I would.~
@18074 = ~Am I to understand that you are from that far away city?~
@18075 = ~Bah! I have heard of such a city but I have my doubts as to whether it even exists!~
@18076 = ~Oh, I actually hail from Waterdeep. The great city of splendors has much more in the manner of social luxuries suited towards my particular tastes. I do, however, make a point of keeping in touch with Neverwinter, though I have only visited once previously. It was quite popular in those nights, if I recall correctly. I'm going to make a second trip in the coming year, and I'll wager it will be as popular again.~
@18077 = ~Perhaps not yet, but soon.~
@18078 = ~Hello... well... I was about to tell you not to come any closer, but that never seems to work, does it? Well regardless, I should remain true to the genre. Don't come any closer or I'll JUMP! Yeah, you heard me, and I'll do it, too! So... don't come any closer... again. And don't try to stop me!~
@18079 = ~O... K? You aren't going to do a thing? Wow. You... you must have incredible faith in my will to live. No one has ever shown such trust in me, not ever! Not even mumsey! Thank you so much for your quiet faith! I choose to live! I CHOOSE TO LIVE! Oh no! I have to get home before mumsey finds the note! She has no stomach for such things. I'll have Jeeves double her usual cocktails and tell her of my new resolve! Thank you so much. Tra La! Life is grand once again!~

@18092 = ~~
@18093 = ~You're right, of course. What a fool I was to think this would solve anything. It didn't solve anything the last time I stood here and was stopped, nor the time before that. I really should develop a better method of dealing with adversity. It's such a long walk as well. Hmm, perhaps if I had mumsey construct a cliff closer to town. Ah well, thanks for your concern. Ta.~
@18094 = ~Protection Scroll~
@18095 = ~A crossbow is a bow mounted crosswise on a wooden or metal shaft, the latter called a tiller. The bow is usually made of ash or yew. The crossbow fires a quarrel (also called a bolt).

@18096 = ~HOW could you be so CALLOUS? I am so obviously in PAIN here! Have you no care for MY needs? No, of course not. No one does. Not mumsey, not daddums, not Jeeves; I bet they'd be glad I was gone. If fact, I'd probably be doing them a favor! That's it, I'll stay alive just to spite them! I'll be the most miserable, selfish, upstart of a child! Actually, this won't be much of a change, but now I'm justified! Life is good.~
@18097 = ~Keep low and quiet! Can you smell it? Ogres on the breeze. Two, maybe more.~
@18098 = ~A Protection from Poison scroll offers protection to the target from all forms of poison, be they of a natural or magical nature. The effect is not permanent, however, and will wear off after 6 hours.

@18099 = ~You seem to know the area pretty well. Do you have any clues about the iron crisis?~
@18100 = ~I ain't got a care for the politics and crap goin' on. Take all that flamin' garbage and toss it to the crows. Take all the metal away too, for all I care. Don't need it to hunt. Don't need it to kill. Don't need it to smell them ogres neither. Take my advice... er... mac, keep yer weapons ready.~
@18101 = ~I sure could use another talented hunter in the party. What do you say?~
@18102 = ~This ain't no team sport, not for me a least. I work alone. Don't need you slowing me down. Take a walk, kiddo.~
@18103 = ~You seem pretty good at what you do.~
@18104 = ~You could say that. Ain't pretty though.~
@18105 = ~If ye don't mind, please try to keep your voices down. There be beasties about with better hearing than we.~
@18106 = ~You seem quite at home out here. What's the most dangerous thing you've seen?~
@18107 = ~What should I be wary of in this area?~
@18108 = ~The most dangerous thing I intentionally went after? Stalked an ogre mage for a few days once. Had a party of me own back then. Killed the ogre, lost the party. Not really worth the trade, if you ask me. I've seen more dangerous beasties, but usually over my shoulder as I'm making tracks as fast as I can. No shame in running when your life is on the line. Off with you now, I've meat to catch.~
@18109 = ~'Round here? I wouldn't worry yourself too much, unless you're brainless and charge everything you see. Mostly gibberlings, but they aren't too much of a hassle. A fair bow and good sword-arm could handle one, maybe two. More with mage or cleric backup. Wolves have become a bit more predatory lately. I think it's because more people are hunting for their food, seein' as how the iron shortage took away their normal livelihoods. A hungry wolf is a nasty thing, and I wouldn't travel without a group if I were you.~
@18110 = ~I did not intend for my words to scare you away. They were a simple warning of dangers true, and meant as nothing more. The occasional chat is certainly welcome, but perhaps today is just not the best day for it. The denizens of this wood seen to have grown rather aggressive lately. As gruesome as it sounds, they've probably become accustomed to humanoid meat. Can't really blame them, though. Too many people lost their means to the iron shortage, and have turned to the land for sustenance. Monsters and animals must find food somewhere. I'd keep your weapons at the ready as you travel.~

@18141 = ~Reports? What reports? Who are you?~
@18142 = ~Of course he has. Am I not among the finest beings to have ever trod the surface of the Realms?~
@18143 = ~Yes, but a necessary one and a useful tool, wouldn't you agree? Like yourselves, we are no friends of the Iron Throne. I have instructed Xzar to accompany you to the Iron Throne tower in the west end of the city. Even madness has its place, yes?~
@18144 = ~Thank you for your assistance.~
@18145 = ~Xzar, Montaron, yourself, these men around you... Who am I dealing with, here?~
@18146 = ~Keep to the shadows.~
@18147 = ~Good day travelers. Mmmm... Edwin, I did not expect to see you so soon. I hope your... business has been attended to Edwin, for if it hasn't, then you should do so soon. I think that Zulkir Nevron would be most disappointed if he were to hear that you failed. That is all that really needs to be said. Good day again, and goodbye.~
@18148 = ~Has Xzar not told you? Perhaps I have spoken too soon. We are the Zhentarim and I am Xzar's superior. He has been making regular reports to me about your party and the progress of your investigations into the iron crisis. Your work has been exemplary and of great service to our cause. Now go, purge this city of the Iron Throne's presence. They have become more than a nuisance to us... They have become a threat.~
@18149 = ~It is so sad to have met you this fine day. Normally, we would be quite ecstatic to have visitors; but in these troubled times we really do desire privacy. We just can't afford to have anyone knowing that we're here. That is why you must die.~
@18150 = ~Yes, he did mention your arrogance... The Iron Throne is based in a tower in the city's west end. I have recommended to Xzar that you focus your investigations there. Now, please, leave us be. It is not wise to speak of these things as openly as we are now.~
@18151 = ~I see Montaron is with you but what of Xzar? By all that is dark, this does not bode well for our plans.~
@18152 = ~Just wait a moment! We won't bother you, just let us go on our way... and you'll never see us again.~
@18153 = ~What plans?~
@18154 = ~Who are you?~
@18155 = ~We're not scared of a bunch of posturing red-robed freaks!~
@18156 = ~Xzar did not have time to tell you, then... The Iron Throne has many enemies. I am one of them. Xzar was another. He had been making regular reports to me about your party and the progress of your investigations into the present crisis. When the last few reports didn't come, I assumed that the messengers had been forced to take a more lengthy route due to the bandit activity. But this, this is far worse. Alone, Montaron is of little use to us and you... I do not know if you can be trusted... Please, leave us be. It is time for us to revise our thinking on this entire matter.~
@18157 = ~Please don't kill us. We don't want to die.~
@18158 = ~Sorry, but the Red Wizards of Thay are not known for their magnanimous nature. We're going to have to kill you.~
@18159 = ~A group of arrogant whelps! This is such a reward, and will make your deaths all the more sweet.~
@18160 = ~If Xzar were still with you, I would tell you more. Suffice to say that we are enemies of the Iron Throne and, for that reason, friends of yours. They are based in a tower on the west end of the city. I would urge you to focus your investigations there.~
@18161 = ~Oh look, what a cute little party... invading our space! We were preparing a ritual, and you all but ruined it.~
@18162 = ~I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something?~
@18163 = ~What do you mean your space? This is a store and I'm a customer.~
@18164 = ~Thank you for that wonderful display of simian logic, now scram.~
@18165 = ~What's a simian?~
@18166 = ~For your information, a number of important sociological and psychological theorists have posited that stores exist in an intermediate space, neither private nor public in nature but combining elements of both. Displays in store windows, for instance, can best be viewed as mental constructs projected onto the public consciousness as a means of engendering mass conformity derived solely from the supposedly private domain of consumer choice...~
@18167 = ~A monkey, a moron, a chimp... Boys, put this one out of its misery.~
@18168 = ~Ack! It's enough to drive one mad... Make it stop, make it stop!~
@18169 = ~Like an extremely difficult spell, perchance? Yes, I would have to say that maybe you ARE interrupting something!~
@18170 = ~I'm very, very sorry. I'll leave now.~
@18171 = ~Then go do it someplace a little more private.~
@18172 = ~-sigh- What does it matter, now? Do what you will...~

@18232 = ~It is so sad to have met you this fine day. Normally, we would be quite ecstatic to have visitors; but in these troubled times we really do desire privacy. We just can't afford to have anyone knowing that we're here. That is why you must die.~
@18233 = ~Just wait a moment! We won't bother you, just let us go on our way... and you'll never see us again.~
@18234 = ~We're not scared of a bunch of posturing red-robed freaks!~
@18235 = ~Please don't kill us. We don't want to die.~
@18236 = ~Sorry, but the Red Wizards of Thay are not known for their magnanimous nature. We're going to have to kill you.~
@18237 = ~A group of arrogant whelps! This is such a reward, and will make your deaths all the more sweet.~
@18238 = ~You would do well to know your own limitations. I don't care whether you're a great swordsman or a powerful wizard, regardless you will end up filleted in the noonday sun if you do not take proper care. Move along, will you? You may be intent on digging an early grave, but I've no wish to share it with you.~
@18239 = ~You on Bar'uk's land! Bar'uk says "go away!" so go!~
@18240 = ~Who is this Bar'uk and what is he going to do about it?~
@18241 = ~We're just passing through and won't be any bother. You have our word.~
@18242 = ~Me be Bar'uk and you make me angry! Attack them!~
@18243 = ~WHAT in the Nine Hells are you doing in my burrow home! I don't know why you're here, but any assumptions you might have about halfling hospitality, does not apply to me. When an intruder breaks into my home, I kill 'em.~
@18244 = ~You're rather obnoxious for a halfling. We'll just let you have your rant, and we'll be on our way.~
@18245 = ~Your word mean nothing to Bar'uk! Kill them!~
@18246 = ~YOU! Kill us?! Don't make us laugh shorty.~
@18247 = ~It sort of smells like kobold in your little hole. I wonder why that is? I thought halflings hated kobolds.~
@18248 = ~I don't think you quite understand. The only thing you'll be doing right now, is dying.~
@18249 = ~Now you've done it. No one calls me shorty.~
@18250 = ~Oh no. You've found me out. Yes, I'm the one who has been letting the kobolds into our quaint little town. It's just too bad that you won't be alive to tell anyone about it.~
@18251 = ~Grrrrruaarr... Wrrrretched forrrtrrresss! If you go therrrre, go to conquerrrrr!~
@18252 = ~What fortress do you mean?~
@18253 = ~I will take no orders from a lowly gnoll. Now prepare to meet your hell...~
@18254 = ~The forrtrrresss to the wesssst! I wisshed to rrrroasst the captive when the otherrrs would rather let herrr live within that cellarrr! Foolss! And now my brrrethrren make me an exile frrrom my own clan! Hearrr me, I ssshall tassste herrr flessh yet!!~
@18255 = ~Die then, wrrrretched pinklingsss!~
@18256 = ~Ah, weary travelers, well met! Neville, the fairest of all fair bandits, at your service. What may I do for you this hour?~
@18257 = ~Did you find all five of them, then? Pity, I shall have to train them better. Anyhow, I'm afraid that I can't abide by your wishes: my men would think me a coward to surrender in the face of such a paltry force. Truly, I see no other choice than to order them to fire at will and rob your sad corpses of any iron they may carry. Come men, I believe the choice before us is clear.~
@18258 = ~Well, for starters, you could tell your men in the bushes to drop their bows and step out into the open.~
@18259 = ~Huurm. I be Larze. You be <CHARNAME>. Don't try deny it. You should not have come to Baldur's Gate. You given many warning before, but you ignore them. Now you must pay. Sorry, but Larze must kill.~
@18260 = ~Perhaps you could escort us through your territory and ensure that we meet with no harm along the way.~
@18261 = ~You could give us all of your money and then let us kill you, one by one.~
@18262 = ~Wait one moment, you big oaf. Why would you think that I'm <CHARNAME>. Do I look like I could be that kind of hero. <CHARNAME> is a juggernaut of destruction, with flaming eyes, and a roaring voice. My companions and I, we're just normal folks.~
@18263 = ~I'm really starting to get tired of threats. Everywhere I go, I'm threatened. Well you big lug, you're going to end up like all the rest of them.~
@18264 = ~How about you just let us go. I'll be walking out that door, right now... okay?~
@18265 = ~Larze will crush you now, crush you to paste.~
@18266 = ~NO! Larze must kill you, and take heads. Heads important, 'cause they are how Larze prove he kill you. Must not forget heads.~
@18267 = ~Huh? But you must be <CHARNAME>. Me see picture, and it look like you. It had no fire eyes or big voice. Though pictures don't have voices. Hmmmmm, I confused.~
@18268 = ~What an interesting proposal. Indeed, we could protect you from any monsters you might encounter or any ill-willed travelers along the way. It would be possible, even likely, except for one minor detail: ahem, you see, we be bandits here. Cut-throats, ne'er-do-wells, tommy-knockers, and such ilk. We could protect you from all but ourselves, our own urges and greed... In truth, that greed overwhelms us now. Attack men, that we might satiate it!~
@18269 = ~That's very good, we'll just be taking our leave of you now. Have a good day, Mr. Larze.~
@18270 = ~Larze, my poor confused ogre. There is only one thing for you to do. You have to go back and take a closer look at the picture. I'm sure once you've had a second look, you'll now what a big mistake you've made. Now run along, we'll be waiting right here.~
@18271 = ~You LIE! You lie to Larze, to try to save life. Larze will crush you now, then he will rip off all of your heads.~
@18272 = ~Yes! Good idea, Larze will find picture and see for sure. You will wait here until Larze gets back.~
@18273 = ~Ho, I shall spare your lives for such a fine show of wit and bravado! What is this harsh life without laughter, anyhow? Come, I shall take a bit of gold from you and then be on my way.~
@18274 = ~Thirty degrees latitude... longitude varying greatly... moons in conjunction with... pardon my lack of focus, but I've been studying the skies for some time now. Now I've a positively wicked kink in my neck, and cannot seem to focus on anything closer than the horizon. Such are the pains of astrology, I suppose.~
@18275 = ~Boo~
@18276 = ~Hey there, fella! Seems like your little party's wandered a bit off the beaten path. Well, that's too bad for you, cause you've had the misfortune of meeting the fastest draw in the west. See that man over yonder. His name's Zal, and he's the fastest dart thrower that has ever walked the Sword Coast. Now, if I were you, I wouldn't want to test the patience of such a man. SO, why don't you do the wise thing and hand over all your money? Otherwise, you're going to be in a heap of trouble.~
@18277 = ~I have little time for such nonsense.~
@18278 = ~And what have your observations revealed to you?~
@18279 = ~Study on, I shall not distract your gaze.~
@18280 = ~I have heard many talk such as you, and if that is honestly your belief, then so be it. There is little I could do to change your mind, even if I wished to waste the energy of trying. It is a shame, though. Such interesting times are ahead. I suppose some of the excitement is in the uncertainty, but I prefer to take whatever advantage I can. My patron is quite rich from my efforts. Regardless, I wish you well on your journeys.~
@18281 = ~Are you some sort of moron? The fastest dart thrower in the west?! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. Bring it on Vax. You tell Zal to show us his stuff.~
@18282 = ~No, stay back, lest this madness be catching!~
@18283 = ~Calm down. What is this madness of which you speak?~
@18284 = ~Well, I don't really want any trouble. Take the money, and just please let us alone.~
@18285 = ~I have heard that diseases of the mind are even more contagious than those of the flesh. Leave me be, for I want none of whatever curse has befallen you.~
@18286 = ~I have no desire to fight a pair of idiots, nor am I going to give you any of our money. Get lost.~
@18287 = ~HEAR THAT ZAL! Seems they don't take you seriously. Guess it's time to show what for, huh? Sorry guys, but you're in for a world of hurt.~
@18288 = ~Oh, I couldn't possibly tell you all that I see. There is so much raw data that must be interpreted and examined thrice over. It is a wonder that even I can assimilate all that information with no ill effects. Still, the long and the short of it reveals interesting times ahead. If I did not know better, I would say that the heavens themselves look on with interest. Conflicts of great significance are on the horizon.~
@18289 = ~I have been a rural merchant all my life and am thereby no stranger to poultry of any shade or color... But there be a fiendish hen to the east that, when I picked her up, she spoke to me in a voice most human. Either I am in the chill grips of the deepest fever or that chicken be possessed by a spirit from the very depths of the ninth and final Hell!~
@18290 = ~Thanks for the money. You made the smart choice. Bye now.~
@18291 = ~Yes, I must be more feverish than the most starkly raving lunatic! My entire life shattered by a hellish chicken-fiend claiming to be the voice of utter reason! How sore and fretful be a wasted life!~
@18292 = ~Why, looky here. A finer bunch of adventurers, I don't think I've ever seen. Hmmm, though from the looks of it, you don't seem to be that well equipped. Well, you're in a lot of luck, I can solve all of your problems. I have a huge collection of potions and scrolls, all for a cheap price. Right now I can give you a potion of extra healing for 25 gold, a scroll of protection from petrification for 25 gold, or a scroll of protection from magic for 100 gold. So what do ya say?~
@18293 = ~Perhaps it is for the best. There are great things on the horizon, and I should devote much time to them if I am to fully understand what is to come. Dangerous days ahead indeed.~
@18294 = ~...the best of schools...~
@18295 = ~...a storehouse of arcane knowledge...~
@18296 = ~...lost, all lost... a common dungeon, now...~
@18297 = ~I know why you're here. It's the same reason everyone else comes to see me, and you shall get the same answer. I do NOT know when the iron shortage will let up, I have NO CLUE as to who controls the bandits in the area, and I have NO INTEREST in accompanying you to the gambling tables in Baldur's Gate.~
@18298 = ~Sorry, but we're not really needing to stock up right now.~
@18299 = ~How about the potion of extra healing.~
@18300 = ~...we all shall live again... someday...~
@18301 = ~Your iron or your life... No, your iron AND your life... Yeah, that one's better.~
@18302 = ~The scroll of protection from petrification looks good.~
@18303 = ~Protection from magic! Say no more, we want that.~
@18304 = ~I don't think we really need to buy anything from you. You hand over all of your precious potions and scrolls, or we'll take them from you by force.~
@18305 = ~What do you want with our iron?~
@18306 = ~You don't know what you're missing.~
@18307 = ~You don't really want to kill us, do you?~
@18308 = ~This potion can be a life saver, trust me.~
@18309 = ~Ours no good! Crumble like elf-bones and make our Clan into laughingstock! Ha ha, big joke... We kill you quick, no pain. Just take iron.~
@18310 = ~Great protection against basilisks. See you later.~
@18311 = ~This scroll is a dandy. If you ever find yourself in a battle against magic users, just read this one off, and you'll have no worries.~
@18312 = ~Yeah, we kill you. Maybe eat you later, once iron smelted.~
@18313 = ~Holy, Bloodthirsty! You guys obviously don't calm down often to think about things much. Okay now, let me explain: I'm selling magic items for cheap. Therefore, I have easy access to said items. Therefore, you just called out the wrong guy.~
@18314 = ~Greetingssss... I am Mutamin. I hope you enjoy the artwork my pretty lizards have sculpted. They sculpt with their eyessss. They sculpt when nasty travelers come by, yesssss. I don't like nasty travelers. They should keep to the roads.~
@18315 = ~Is it just me, or is the world filled with wackos. Okay, Mr. psycho gnome, I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but we're really not interested in your rock garden.~
@18316 = ~Whoa, slow down! I'm trying to plan the grandest of heists, here. With all your tromping about, I can't hear a word I'm thinking!~
@18317 = ~You murdering psychopath! Your lizards have killed people, and we're not about to let them keep on killing.~
@18318 = ~Ummmm. Well it was really nice talking to you, but we have to go.~
@18319 = ~You will go nowhere! You will join the beautiful work of art that standssss before you. You will become a piece of the art... forever.~
@18320 = ~Of course you can't hear a word you're thinking. You have to say it out loud, first.~
@18321 = ~Pardon me, but if you do not trouble yourself with the events of the day, what purpose do your star-gazings serve?~
@18322 = ~A heist? That's not particularly noble or, uh, legal of you...~
@18323 = ~Okay, okay, here's the plan: There's a big-time mage living just over that rise. Magic items scattered all over the place, I'm betting... Trouble is, he's got these two hideous flesh monsters guarding him and no shadows where I can lurk! Brute force is useless against the monsters, everything is useless. There must be a way to outwit the witless but damned if I know how... Ah hell, I guess I'd be better off just finding a halfling village somewhere to pick on. This dive is all yours.~
@18324 = ~What good are your musings if they do not have practical use? Perhaps your predictions are not as accurate as you would have people believe?~
@18325 = ~I've no wish to disturb you further, and shall be on my way.~
@18326 = ~Please, wait a moment. I must talk with you. It is very important.~
@18327 = ~I... I am sorry for my rudeness. It would seem that I was quite disturbed even before you came anywhere near me. I simply get tired of the asking, especially when people find the answers too vague. The stars are not a reference book with everything laid out plain. Were it so, anyone could pick the page they wished and there would be no need for one such as I. As it is, I have little to say of our current troubles.~
@18328 = ~Sure, what do you have to tell us, gnome?~
@18329 = ~Sorry, but we don't have the time to chat with some geezer gnome.~
@18330 = ~Of all the rude... fine, good riddance.~
@18331 = ~Thank you... just let an old man catch his breath... Now then, let me introduce myself, I am Hafiz bin Watat, astrologer, scientist and mage. Please, tell me your name.~
@18332 = ~Sure, my name's <CHARNAME>.~
@18333 = ~Are you nuts! I'm not telling you my name. For all I know, you might be some crazy assassin. Gods know there's been enough of them. Get out of here, old man.~
@18334 = ~Perhaps they are not accurate? Specific they may not be, but do not presume to question my accuracy! I recognize rotations and alignments more accurately than most people recognize their children! You are indeed a shortminded fool if you discount me just because I don't concern myself with parlor tricks! The nerve! Leave me, and don't darken my path again.~
@18335 = ~Fine, then. I'll let you take care of all that noble and legal stuff and I'll get on with being a thief, now get lost.~
@18336 = ~<CHARNAME>! Yes, that's the name I remember. I've seen your face in my dreams. Mmmmm. The dreams of you are always ones of blood and death, and there is another man who watches, an evil man. They always end with your death or mine. It is so strange that I should meet you, the focus of these dreams. You must be very special. Tell me about yourself, perhaps I can help you.~
@18337 = ~Go no further! You are with the party of <CHARNAME>, are you not?~
@18338 = ~What purpose? The Sword Coast is by no means the center of the universe. Lives and dramas are lived out across the Realms. There are lands closer than you would think that neither know nor care about our little problems.~
@18339 = ~That we are, and a goodly party it is, sir. How may we help you?~
@18340 = ~I don't really have anything to tell, especially to one that I know so little about. I must take my leave of you, gnome. Hopefully now that we have met your dreams will end.~
@18341 = ~I've never heard of such a person. Why do you seek them?~
@18342 = ~Well, gnome, if your dreams always ended with one of us dead, then perhaps we shouldn't be talking at all. It's not personal, Hafiz, but I really want to be the one who comes out of the dream still breathing.~
@18343 = ~By surrendering yourselves and not dragging this out any longer than is necessary. Your evil ways have brought a fair bounty upon your heads and I am here to collect it in the service of these woods.~
@18344 = ~Well, just across the southern mountains there are troubles brewing in great Amn that will make our current concerns seem small by comparison. To the far north there is a city where winter never rears its ugly head; a city that has not been seen nor heard from for many a year, but will soon welcome the return of a multitude of citizens. Both of these events will unfold regardless of our current troubles. Great may be our concerns, but much more is on the horizon. Leave me be, I have much to think upon.~
@18345 = ~There's quite a bit to say, I don't really know if I have the time to go into all of the details. I used to live at Candlekeep with my father Gorion. A little while back we were forced to flee. Seems like there's someone out there who really wants me dead. In trying to kill me, he... killed my dad.~
@18346 = ~I have no time for the problems of lands far away. I can barely keep up with domestic concerns as it is.~
@18347 = ~And what of these lands? What intrigues lay beyond our borders?~
@18348 = ~I, as well, hope that my dreams will end. Perhaps we shall meet again. Goodbye <CHARNAME>.~
@18349 = ~They are a band of uncivilized cut-throats and murderers. A bounty has been placed on their heads and they have been rumored to be heading this way. I would advise you to be wary of anyone matching their description...~
@18350 = ~Perhaps what you say is true. It becomes obvious to me that you have a demeanor of evil. If it is combat that you desire, then that is what you will have.~
@18351 = ~I am sorry to bring back such painful memories. I wish to help you, and in doing so, end these dreams that plague me. Here, take this. When you do battle against the six who serve your father's killer, read this scroll and it will protect you from their wrath. Goodbye now; perhaps we shall meet again.~
@18352 = ~Wait! My bears have sensed an evil about you that I had failed to see... Your devious ways stop here, <CHARNAME>!~
@18353 = ~Your focus will benefit you in the short term, but there will come a time when the Sword Coast is at peace once again. As long as you do not dwell upon the past, simply because it used to be your present. Oh dear, I may have confused myself with that last piece of... wisdom. I should really not stare at the stars quite so vigorously. Leave me, I must rest.~
@18354 = ~Come quickly, you are just in time for my experiment!~
@18355 = ~Who might you be then? Ahh, great adventurers no doubt? I could tell by your hands. Stained with magic and the effort of hefting a weapon. Such markings may be invisible to the average eye, but I can see them plain as day. I can see a lot plain as day. Care for a consultation? Perhaps a little old fashioned palm reading? A little gypsy magic to steer your course straight and true?~
@18356 = ~I know enough about magical experimentation to know that I want no part of it. You are on your own, kind sir.~
@18357 = ~Travelers from the north, halt! You trespass quite deep into Amnian territory. Perhaps you have come to spy upon our supposed troop buildup. It's quite funny, the stupid notions you northern barbarians can get stuck in your heads.~
@18358 = ~What kind of experiment are you attempting?~
@18359 = ~Offer a child wisdom and they choose folly, offer a fish water and it chooses sand. May you gain in ignorance what you have lost in knowledge, friends.~
@18360 = ~Are you saying that Amn does not threaten Baldur's Gate?~
@18361 = ~I am tired of being insulted by every pompous idiot that I come across. Draw steel!~
@18362 = ~Who are you, and what do you want?~
@18363 = ~Of course not. Our mighty nation has better things to do than attack some self important barbarian city. Anyhow, take our advice, and go back from whence you came.~
@18364 = ~Begone. I have no use for your rambling incantations. I have access to my own magic.~
@18365 = ~No doubt you do, but what I offer is not magic in your sense, but rather a reading of YOU. Nothing to do with summoning energy, just the reading of that which is already there. Give me your palm and I shall demonstrate.~
@18366 = ~I believe I have developed a spell to empathically control any gelatinous creature and bend it to your will. Slimes, jellies, oozes, all of these things that foul the cook's cellar and the adventurer's dungeon can now be controlled and eradicated with an ease and efficacy never before seen in the history of the Realms. It takes an entire hour to gain such control, but that time will be minimized with further experimentation, I am sure. In moments, that hour will be up for a small number of mustard jellies that I have released into the nearby woods. We shall soon bear witness to the results of my endeavor.~
@18367 = ~Before you go, who are you that you would roam about the Cloud Peaks. It is a very dangerous place at this time of year.~
@18368 = ~I have no interest! Twice I have said this, so leave me be!~
@18369 = ~I see no harm in a little divination on your part. Here is my palm. What does it tell you?~
@18370 = ~We will be going nowhere. We have as much right to be here as you do.~
@18371 = ~Goodbye. May your travels be safe.~
@18372 = ~Let's have a look now. Interesting. Though you live the hard life now, your hand tells of a softer existence not long ago. I assume that you have just recently taken to the road?~
@18373 = ~Why, it seems that we have stumbled upon some berserkers. I had suspected as much when I caught your scent a few moments ago, but your behavior clinches it. Delgod! Alexander! Let us make short work of these peasants.~
@18374 = ~I am Sendai, of the noble merchant house of Argrims, foremost family in Amn. Delgod, Alexander and I have come out here to hunt game. Though perhaps you would make for better sport. I assume you would have no problem with this?~
@18375 = ~That much is true, yes. Do go on.~
@18376 = ~Are you mad, experimenting on creatures and then releasing them into the wild before witnessing the spell's true effect?!~
@18377 = ~I thought as much. Lets have a little closer look now. Back down your life line. I see a scholarly influence, and you are well educated. You had a mentor that was a great sage? Perhaps of considerable power as well?~
@18378 = ~What kind of monster would hunt his fellow human like a wild animal?~
@18379 = ~I do not wish to know your opinion of my manicure. enough of this foolishness.~
@18380 = ~Those are fighting words missy, and I think you'll soon regret you ever said them.~
@18381 = ~Goodbye peasants. I wish you luck on your journeys, you'll probably need it.~
@18382 = ~Of course I was not serious. What I said, I did in jest. You with your barbarian mentality would of course misconstrue my meaning.~
@18383 = ~Fascinating. You must write this spell down for me that my party can make use of it in our adventures.~
@18384 = ~Rest your fears. I prepared thoroughly for the casting and could not have made a single mistake, unless... oh my... The wording... The wording, I got it wrong! Rather than controlling them, I fear I have transformed them into the a far greater menace: the dreaded green slime. Stay and fight them if you will but, whatever you do, do not let them touch you!~
@18385 = ~Sure lady. We'll be going now.~
@18386 = ~Well, perhaps you won't misconstrue this. Draw steel!~
@18387 = ~You surrender, or you die. You make choice, and you make choice quickly! Zargal, has no patience to wait for slow witted city folk.~
@18388 = ~I have worked years for this and you seek its benefits in mere seconds? Nay, you not only seek them, you expect them! The spell is mine and you'll not take it from me! Come jellies, let us make our mark upon the world!~
@18389 = ~Time to die, you ugly knobgoblins.~
@18390 = ~We surrender already. Just stop pointing those swords at us, and we'll all be better for it. What is it that you want exactly?~
@18391 = ~You very stupid for city folk. You die screaming. ZARGAL STRONGEST ONE THERE IS!!!~
@18392 = ~Zargal want all of your money. Give Zargal your money, and Zargal will let you live.~
@18393 = ~You have to be joking. Our money is very important to us. If we just gave it to every foul-smelling hobgoblin who happened by... well we wouldn't get far in life, now would we?~
@18394 = ~Here! Take it. Take every last coin.~
@18395 = ~You make smart decision. You get to live.~
@18396 = ~Please, I beg of you to go no further! Brage is there, strewn about with the carnage he has wrought. I have tried to reason with him but it is as if he is possessed by another's soul. It was all I could do to flee the swing of his tremendous blade. Please, unless you wish to witness madness in a once-good man, leave him be and pray the spirit leaves him in good time.~
@18397 = ~He's driving me... mad! Oh please make it stop, make him stop his screaming. AAAHhhhhhh... Shut it up!~
@18398 = ~Who is this Brage you speak of?~
@18399 = ~If this Brage be possessed by some foul spirit, then I'm afraid we must kill the man to unman the beast. Let us pass and pity him not for, if asked, he would wish it himself.~
@18400 = ~What's wrong? What is driving you to madness. Lady, if you want help, you're going to have to calm down.~
@18401 = ~Get away from us you crazy wench!~
@18402 = ~No one will help me... no one will help...~
@18403 = ~Before this curse befell him, he was Captain of the Guard in Nashkel. I am his cousin, Laryssa. For all the bonds of love and blood, save him from his present agony if there be a way to do so.~
@18404 = ~He... it's in my head. It won't be quiet, just keeps on whispering, and whispering. You see this jar. Do you SEE it?!!!~
@18405 = ~We see the jar lady, now just calm down and tell us what's happening.~
@18406 = ~You're a crazy one. Too crazy for us. Take your jar and get away from us.~
@18407 = ~My companions and I... we explored the Firewine ruins... and we found... we found, this jar. It... it drove them all mad. They hacked and they cut, and... the blood, so much blood. They're all dead now, and only I'm left. The voice... it tells me to say the name. If I say the name, it promises great rewards. But... I won't... I won't.~
@18408 = ~He may wish it but I would not! There be a man behind those shattered eyes, and a cousin to my flesh. If you so seek to kill him, then you be as mad as he! Come, draw your blades and rend this flesh that stands before you!~
@18409 = ~What do you want us to do lady. How can we help you?~
@18410 = ~If you feel you must, then I see no harm.~
@18411 = ~Give us the jar, we'll know what to do with it.~
@18412 = ~Poor Carsa cannot be helped. You can't help Carsa! You must run, and run fast. Soon Carsa will not be able to resist... soon Carsa will say its name. Then it will come... and there will be blood... my blood, your blood.~
@18413 = ~You had a reasonably happy childhood with him, aside from being a little difficult. My my, but you were quite the little hellion. Wonder where that comes from? Let's see what we can't learn about you back before this Gorion. Further back I see... I see... Madre de merced! I-see-a-long-and-happy-life-for-you-and-yours. 10 gold please and I'll be on my way.~
@18414 = ~My foster father Gorion was a sage, and a bit of a mage as well. Go on.~
@18415 = ~NO! Carsa will not give the jar. The jar is Carsa's and hers alone. Get away... get away or Carsa will say the name... and we will all die.~
@18416 = ~Oh, end this game. I do not wish to indulge this any further.~
@18417 = ~Ahhh, I think we had better get away from this woman quickly. Okay Carsa, thanks for everything. Good luck on the jar thing.~
@18418 = ~Just give us the jar Carsa. We'll know what to do with it. Don't worry.~
@18419 = ~Whoa! This is getting a little crazy. You just keep the jar, and we'll get out of here.~
@18420 = ~Give us the jar Carsa. Give it to us now!~
@18421 = ~You not take the jar from Carsa. It's mine. MINE!! Stay away, or I say the name. Stay away.~
@18422 = ~I think this one's a lost cause. All right Carsa, you keep your jar and we'll be on our way.~
@18423 = ~We're taking the jar from you, whether you like it or not.~
@18424 = ~Bye bye... ahahahah... see you later or sooner, but most likely never.~
@18425 = ~Sssh! I'm spyin' on Bassilus an' his spooks. They're funny.~
@18426 = ~NOOOoooo...

KAHRK!!

OH MIGHTY KAHRK!!!~
@18427 = ~I ain't got no home to go to there, not since Mom an' Johnny disappeared. I been looking for them but all I can ever find is these spooks. One of them's wearing Johnny's knickers, though, but I don't want to think of where it got 'em... Be careful you don't scare Bassilus, okay?~
@18428 = ~This is no place for a child! Return home to Beregost at once and run every step of the way!~
@18429 = ~Well, a happy ending after all. Here's your gold. Thanks for the reading.~
@18430 = ~I've never heard of a funny spook before... Why are they so funny?~
@18431 = ~I change my mind, I shan't touch it! I take nothing from you! Leave me!~
@18432 = ~I am free... at last. Mortals, before you die, know that you have pleased KAHRK, mightiest of the ogre magi. Your deaths shall feed my power, for now I am weak.~
@18433 = ~What? What is it that you saw?~
@18434 = ~I saw nothing! You will live long and enjoy life and I will be going now! Back from me!~
@18435 = ~Suit yourself. Here is the gold you asked for.~
@18436 = ~You must tell me, please dear lady.~
@18437 = ~I have told all I am going to. Stay back from me! Your life is none of my affair!~
@18438 = ~Please, I don't mean to be rude. Just tell me what your vision revealed.~
@18439 = ~As you would have it. here is the gold you asked for.~
@18440 = ~Stay away from me! I warn you, I'll not let you near me!~
@18441 = ~If that is what you wish, so be it. I would be a touch more polite to old gypsy women in your future though. Not all would take your rebuff as good-naturedly. Fare thee well.~
@18442 = ~Bassilus keeps on tellin' these stories about how happy he was as a kid but all of the spooks just kinda moan and mumble and stuff, like they're not really listening. That's what my brother Johnny used to do before he disappeared, mumble like that when he weren't really listening... You stay here. I'm gonna go tell my friend Netty 'bout this place. She'll think its really funny, what with her Daddy gone and all.~
@18443 = ~Not to be rude, but will you stand a bit back from me? By all the gods I shall be glad to be back in Waterdeep come the new tenday.~
@18444 = ~Stop where you are! If you throw down your weapons and co-operate, then no one will be hurt. If you don't, then you'll all die. A very simple decision on your part.~
@18445 = ~Was your trip business or pleasure?~
@18446 = ~What do you find so displeasing about the Sword Coast?~
@18447 = ~There is a toll for passing this way, friends, and it happens to be your life. Are you willing to part with it?~
@18448 = ~What is it you want with us, and who are you?~
@18449 = ~I care not for your whining. Go where you will, but get out of my way first and foremost.~
@18450 = ~We surrender to no one. Draw steel!~
@18451 = ~Stupid, STUPID!! Now you die!~
@18452 = ~My name is Teyngan, this is my girl Jemby. The ugly one is Zekar. What we want is your money. Hand over all your cash, and you'll be unharmed. Before you do anything rash, think it over awhile. I'm sure your life is worth more than the little gold you might possess.~
@18453 = ~Greedy bandits. You infest our roads with your stink. Draw steel!~
@18454 = ~Take my life if you will but I warn you now: make one move and your own is forfeit.~
@18455 = ~Here's our money. Can we leave now?~
@18456 = ~Business, to be sure! I take no pleasure in being in these backwater towns. If not for the bandits I would have been back amidst my silks some days ago! My corgis are going to be worried sick, sick I tell you! What would you know of it. You people around here are animals! You live in filth, bandits everywhere, and not a decent bathhouse to be found!~
@18457 = ~Smart choice. I'm glad you have some sense. Off with you now.~
@18458 = ~Please, you may take my money but life is sacred.~
@18459 = ~Then let these subtle games begin! Fire, comrades, and let us be richer for their folly!~
@18460 = ~What do I NOT find displeasing! Aesthetically the air is absolutely THICK with manual labor. If this is what the land is like with most of its miners out of work, I could not imagine it in full swing. I simply MUST get out of here. If not for the bandits I would be on the FIRST caravan out of town. Curse this merchant's trade! Father must wish me dead to inflict this upon me! Away from me, I need my air.~
@18461 = ~Look, comrades, we have a pack of pathetic and sniveling lumps before us! Very well, we shall rob you of your coin and leave your so-called "sacred" life intact. May the gods bless you for such a display of honor.~
@18462 = ~How typical of the savages I have met here. Rude as can be, and personal hygiene that would choke the stoutest ox. I could not relieve myself of your presence fast enough.~
@18463 = ~Greeting little ones. You have the look of experienced travelers, and a few of you look to be fine warriors. My name is Meilum, I'm the Sword Coast's most skilled swordsman. You may have heard of my name, I'm quite famous after all.~
@18464 = ~Hi. I'm Larry. This is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl. We're real pleased to meet you.~
@18465 = ~You are from Waterdeep? I should like to visit that great city someday.~
@18466 = ~I doubt you would find MY circles to your taste. Not nearly enough mongrel people wandering about smelling up the place. No, you stick to your environment, and I shall gladly retreat to mine.~
@18467 = ~No, we haven't heard your name before. We'd just like to be on our way.~
@18468 = ~If you're such a good swordsman, why are you wandering about the wilderness dressed in what amounts to rags?~
@18469 = ~Why would an xvart, a kobold, and a tasloi be wandering around calling themselves Larry, Darryl, and Darryl?~
@18470 = ~Hold your place! I know not what claims you make to intelligence, but if you understand my words you will not move!~
@18471 = ~Wow! The best swordsman on the Sword Coast. It's an honor to meet such a distinguished man.~
@18472 = ~Larry, Darryl, and Darryl?!! Hey, can I get your autographs?~
@18473 = ~Yes, I know, I know. I'm quite unbeatable. Never lost a fight once. Sometimes it can be a pain being such a renowned swordsman. You know... people making challenges, women throwing their underpants. But what can a man do? If you're born with a skill, you might as well show it off.~
@18474 = ~See Darryl, I told you these guys were the wrong generation!~
@18475 = ~Hey, Darryl, come quick! These folks want us to sign an ee-lek-tronik autograph for 'em... -scribble scribble scribble-~
@18476 = ~Ye natty clap-dragon. We're making a challenge, so draw steel and we'll see who's the best swordsman on the Sword Coast.~
@18477 = ~Well, it was nice meeting you Meilum. Maybe we'll meet again, and you could show us a few of your techniques.~
@18478 = ~You've never heard my name! Why, that's impossible. I'm famous. Think hard... you have heard of Meilum the masterful.~
@18479 = ~Nope... can't say that we've heard of anyone known as Meilum the (heh heh) "Masterful."~
@18480 = ~Yes... now that I've thought harder, I do remember the name Meilum. Wow, I'm in the presence of a real sword saint.~
@18481 = ~Are you insulting me?!?! You had better not dare to insult me, or I'll show you the metal of my blade. Once I've drawn my sword, I'm honor-bound to whet the blade.~
@18482 = ~Well why don't you draw your sword then, so that we can see who the better swordsman is: you or our party.~
@18483 = ~No I'm not insulting you. Just calm down. We'll be on our way now.~
@18484 = ~Now you've done it. You'll be sorry for doubting my skill... so very sorry.~
@18485 = ~All right then, I'd better be off now. You know how it is, places to go, people to meet.~
@18486 = ~Hmmph! Goodbye and good riddance.~
@18487 = ~...flesh here... enough to make me... whole again...~
@18488 = ~Halt, wraith, and reveal thy nature!~
@18489 = ~You'll taste this flesh over my dead body! ...Wait a minute...~
@18490 = ~Hey Lindin, look over here, we've run across some travelers.~
@18491 = ~...I am Icharyd... greatest of warriors... I wish to live and... taste blood, once more... Yours shall be the first... in a hundred years...~
@18492 = ~...yes, I shall... taste... your flesh and... cover these old... bones...~
@18493 = ~Good day! Consider yourself victimized by Vitiare, master thief and pickpocket extraordinaire! No time to chat!~
@18494 = ~Hi, I'm Noober. Nice place, huh?~
@18495 = ~Hey there, my name's Kirian. Me and my buds are an adventuring band. You look to be the same, except -snicker-, a little worse for wear. Still learning the ropes of the business, eh?~
@18496 = ~What are you talking about, little girl, we've much more experience than the rag-tag band of yours you call an adventuring party.~
@18497 = ~So, killed any monsters yet?~
@18498 = ~Ever been to Baldur's Gate? I've been to Baldur's Gate.~
@18499 = ~What is the meaning of this? I demand you move aside!~
@18500 = ~I understand your words, and now I'm going to feed them to you!~
@18501 = ~Watch your mouth, lest I smash it.~
@18502 = ~Ugh, I think I stepped in something.~
@18503 = ~Ya, ya, say what you want, we'll be going now.~
@18504 = ~There is no need for insults, I shall do what you ask.~
@18505 = ~Ha ha! Look at the losers run; too scared that they'd get their butts whupped.~
@18506 = ~Well! So you are quite intelligent after all. From the tales of your actions I had expected to find you little more than an animal. Since you are so adamant, I shall indeed tell you our intent! Your life is to end here today! My brethren might be content to watch you rampage about, but we are not!~
@18507 = ~Everyone in town used to throw rocks at me and tell me I was annoying.~
@18508 = ~What time is it?~
@18509 = ~I haven't had a conversation this long, well... ever!~
@18510 = ~Your brethren? And who might you and "your brethren" claim to be? What is this group I have somehow angered?~
@18511 = ~That sounds like a challenge! Hey Baerin, Peter, Lindin! I think these little pipsqueaks think they can take us. Boy oh boy, you just moved into the big time. We're not some small town hick adventurers, we're Waterdhavian: born and bred. Maybe you want to rethink your earlier statements?~
@18512 = ~What's that big weapon for?~
@18513 = ~I do not take kindly to threats. Leave, and mayhap you will live to realize how close to death you came!~
@18514 = ~Those colors look pretty stoopid on you...~
@18515 = ~I think you psychopaths need a good lesson, and we'll be the ones to administer it to you.~
@18516 = ~I care not for your sanctimonious tone. Bring it on, if you must!~
@18517 = ~Look, we don't want any trouble. So we'll just be on our way and pretend that none of this happened.~
@18518 = ~I once knew this guy named Dilby. He threw rocks at me too. Are you gonna throw rocks at me?~
@18519 = ~You have done nothing to us directly, but those who harp protect all people of nature good and true. You have committed many vile acts upon the citizens of this land, and have been judged unworthy of the gift of life! I no longer care to observe your mission or destiny! Whether your ultimate fate is for the better or worse, I do not care. Whether the Harper Masters only wish to observe, I do not care! Your evil will end here!~
@18520 = ~Really? Come on now, let's be real. Look at yourselves. The bunch of you have about as much style as a pack of gibberlings. The way you hold yourselves, pathetic. All you are is a bunch of hicks who slapped on some armor and weapons and decided that they could be adventurers. It's real sad.~
@18521 = ~What about now?~
@18522 = ~Gee, you sure are patient. I've run out of things to say.~
@18523 = ~SAD!! I'll show you sad, you arrogant little girl. You've had it coming since we started talking. Draw steel, bitch!~
@18524 = ~We don't want any trouble, just let us alone.~
@18525 = ~Ohh, and what kind of lesson is that going to be? Are you going to paddle my rump with a big bad sword. HEY GUYS! Let's take these chimps out.~
@18526 = ~Fight as you will, for I expected nothing less! You brutality is well known to me, and to all who have been watching! I can no longer watch! I must act!~
@18527 = ~Ah, if it isn't <CHARNAME> and the fair adventurers of the Coast! Come, let me summon an army of kobolds that I might see your prowess in action! I have long waited to meet your band and test their mettle in battle.~
@18528 = ~Wait! No... uh, we would... heh heh, hate to, uh... frighten you with such a scene of— yes, of carnage and destruction! Besides, it's all fun and games until someone loses an eye...~
@18529 = ~So you are as articulate as you are evil. Funny how it is often such. Funny how little I care! The time has come for your life to end, and it shall be by my wrath that it comes to pass.~
@18530 = ~I am ready for you. Throw your life at me and I shall gladly take it!~
@18531 = ~If you summon them, then we shall slaughter! What a grand suggestion to break the monotony of this day's travel...~
@18532 = ~Such righteous words. They sound as though you are trying to convince yourself of your task.~
@18533 = ~But— But... You're no valiant adventurers, you're just a bunch of cowards! Well, fine, let me teach you courage, then!~
@18534 = ~No! I am as sure of this as anything! I can stand by no longer! I care not what your actions were to have accomplished! Let the Masters watch if they will, but this Harper will no longer stand by! Defend yourself!~
@18535 = ~Let the frivolities begin, then!~
@18536 = ~If that is what you wish, then prepare to die a useless death!~
@18537 = ~No.~
@18538 = ~No? But you must! How can you not? I will strike you down where you stand if you do not!~
@18539 = ~I gave you a chance to live. Now you will rot in the sun!~
@18540 = ~You will do no such thing. You will sheath your blade and you will scamper home.~
@18541 = ~Why would I do such a thing? Your evil must be stopped, and I will strike you down defenseless if I must!~
@18542 = ~Your blood will make the trees here fertile indeed! Die as you should, whelp!~
@18543 = ~You will not. You will not strike down a defenseless opponent. It sounds as though you have sacrificed quite a few principles to come this far. Shall you sacrifice the rest and kill me where I stand? If you do, are you not just... like... me?~
@18544 = ~Wha... NO! Nothing is like you! You are evil... you are... I'm nothing like you.~
@18545 = ~Not yet, eh child? Not YET.~
@18546 = ~Oooh, the Masters were right about you, you ARE a cagey one. I will leave... for now. You may have shaken my resolve, but it will not change your eventual fate. Nothing can do that.~
@18547 = ~If you wish to die, I shall be happy to be your means!~
@18548 = ~Such brash words from one so young. Are you as sure of your mission as you think?~
@18549 = ~You do not yet know how "close to death" you are. That is why I must strike you down before any more harm is done! I cannot wait for events to unfold as the lethargic Masters do! This is the time to act!~
@18550 = ~Cure Serious Wounds~
@18551 = ~I can't stan' the way the roads are cut off these days! Me uncle's in Baldur's Gate an' I can't get there to see 'im.~
@18552 = ~How come the roads are cut off?~
@18553 = ~What does your uncle do?~
@18554 = ~Where you been these past few months? The roads are crawling with brigands and bandits after every scrap o' iron you got on ye. Surely you must have fled some on your trip here... lest you came by the west road, that is.~
@18555 = ~Well, for your sake and mine, I hope the roads clear up soon. I'll see you around.~
@18556 = ~Why is the west road still open?~
@18557 = ~Well, I sure ain't going nowheres.~
@18558 = ~If there's ever a book shortage, that road to Candlekeep will be the most dangerous of them all, I assure you. But these folks are after metal so they're sticking mainly to the larger trade routes between Baldur's Gate and Amn... An' guess what: this here inn is smack dab in the middle o' it all.~
@18559 = ~'E's a mage and a crotchety ol' one at that. Goes by the name of Ragefast though as kids we always called him Grumpleskin! Har, if he ever caught us at it, he'd cast barkskin on us so we'd wander around all brown-skinned and green-haired and funny-lookin' for a few hours.~
@18560 = ~Welcome to the Friendly Arm Inn. Looks like you had a rough journey.~
@18561 = ~This place is a fortress! Why all the security?~
@18562 = ~Yes, the roads were crazy. Who are you, anyway?~
@18563 = ~Bentley wanted the inn to be a safe haven for all sorts of travelers. Anyone can stay here, but we don't tolerate any troublemaking within these walls.~
@18564 = ~Did Bentley build this place? It's so solid, it looks like it's been here forever!~
@18565 = ~Who are you, anyway?~
@18566 = ~Oh no, Bentley and Gellana didn't build the Inn! They found it... They were part of an adventuring party, not unlike your own. In the first few years following the Time of Troubles, when all the gods were walking the surface of our world, the inn was actually the hold of a powerful, undead priest of Bhaal, god of murder. With the evil cleric weakened by the death of his god, Bentley and Gellana were able to destroy him once and for all, thus laying claim to his troubled fortress.~
@18567 = ~They must have lots of stories to tell!~
@18568 = ~There's more to this place than I would have guessed.~
@18569 = ~I'm sure they do. But this inn is their life, now, and they don't like to dwell on the past. You're as likely to get a tale out of them as you are to get a tooth from the mouth of a hen. It has been a pleasure meeting you, however, and I do hope you enjoy your stay.~
@18570 = ~I have nothing to say to you, go away.~
@18571 = ~Ankheg Shell~
@18572 = ~The present is always a thin veneer over the past. Look closely at any building in the Sword Coast region and you can be sure that its stones are held in place by history's mortar.~
@18573 = ~My name is Nessie. The Mirrorshades hired me to work at the Inn almost five years ago and now I wouldn't leave it for the life of me. It's wonderful here, with new faces passing through every day.~
@18574 = ~Who are the Mirrorshades?~
@18575 = ~Oh, Bentley and Gellana. They run the place. Bentley's behind the bar, there, and you can usually find Gellana in the temple. I'm usually here, waiting tables and making sure everything stays nice and clean.~
@18576 = ~So who are the new faces here, now?~
@18577 = ~With the roads being what they are right now, there aren't too many faces around here that are new anymore. Unshey's been taking this time to write a new book, and Khalid and Jaheira have been waiting anxiously in the corner over there, sleeping in shifts to make sure they don't miss whoever it is they're waiting for... Who else? Let's see, Landrin's on the top floor, drinking up a storm, and then there was... well, Tarnesh... I'm really sorry he caused you trouble—he was all wit and charm until he heard that there were visitors at the gate... We don't allow any fighting here. We have very strict rules about that sort of thing but the guards say he jumped out of the shadows at you and there was nothing you could do... That's really about it. Everyone else has been here for the past two months, at least. We're so full that there's even been talk of letting people throw down their bedrolls in the temple.~
@18578 = ~Free Action~
@18579 = ~Hmm... more adventurers, eh? I'd leave while you still can if I were you. I've heard awful stories about what's been happening to those that go deeper into the mines.~
@18580 = ~Why? What have you heard?~
@18581 = ~Oh, We'll be alright, but thanks for your concern.~
@18582 = ~Well, my friend Ruffie barely escaped with his life he did. Little demons jumped out of the very walls and chased him down. He'd be dead now if it weren't for the guards that came running. Course... them guards are dead now. Old Ruffie's around here somewhere. You ask him what he saw and he'll tell ya.~
@18583 = ~Hmph... no concern of mine if you go and get yerself killed.~
@18584 = ~Wha... what do you want?~
@18585 = ~Tell me about the mines... what's been making the miners disappear?~
@18586 = ~Neutralize Poison~
@18587 = ~What did these demons look like?~
@18588 = ~Demons! The little devils are everywhere I tell ya! In the walls, there's coming! They're going to kill us all.~
@18589 = ~What did they look like!?! They looked like demon's, ya blasted idiot!~
@18590 = ~What? Oh.. it's just another fool here to save us. Go ahead, try to rid the mine of all its evil and get yourself killed like the last couple.~
@18591 = ~Last couple what?~
@18592 = ~What's been happening in the mines lately?~
@18593 = ~Adventurers, ya idiot. Ye think you're the first to try to save us all? Not likely, not going to be the last I'll wager either.~
@18594 = ~How should I know? All I know is good miners are disappearing and nobody seems to care.~
@18595 = ~He... hello there. Is there something you want?~
@18596 = ~So, what do you think has been happening with the mines?~
@18597 = ~Didn't you know? The mines are haunted!. The ghosts of all those that have died in the mine are here to kill us all. They said they'd spare me. Liked me they did. Could see it in their beady little eyes.~
@18598 = ~Of course I saw something! Had a nice long conversation with the little chap. Would have asked him to stop haunting us too if the supervisor hadn't kicked me. Said I was sleeping on the job! Can you imagine?~
@18599 = ~You go down any further, and the ghost will get ya!~
@18600 = ~Nothing we want from you, just get back to your mining.~
@18601 = ~Cure Critical Wounds~
@18602 = ~You saw something?~
@18603 = ~Never mind.~
@18604 = ~Hi, <CHARNAME>, I hope your stay has been comfortable, so far.~
@18605 = ~What is it you want, can't you see I'm a busy man?!~
@18606 = ~Flame Strike~
@18607 = ~I've heard that there have been problems with the mine recently. I'm here to try to help.~
@18608 = ~Hmph. I don't know what you can do about it. Sure there have been problems, the ore that we've been pulling outta this place has been crumbling almost as soon as it's cast.~
@18609 = ~And what about the miners?~
@18610 = ~Aargh, look at these forks and tankards! This iron shortage shows no mercy on us drunkards and culinaires!!~
@18611 = ~Do you know what's been weakening the ore?~
@18612 = ~Have you heard anything about creatures in the mines?~
@18613 = ~They keep disappearing one by one. I'm missing four right now. In the last few weeks alone we've buried at least five others.~
@18614 = ~If I knew that we would have already fixed it!~
@18615 = ~Oh, the miners talk. They'll tell you stories about evil creatures and how the whole place is haunted. I don't believe any of it. Poor maggots are probably just getting lost in the dark if ya ask me.~
@18616 = ~Whatever could be wrong with your fork and tankard?~
@18617 = ~Sorry to bother you.~
@18618 = ~Is there any way I can help you?~
@18619 = ~Try to keep from bothering the miners, they got a lot of work to do. Got that!~
@18620 = ~Raise Dead~
@18621 = ~They be made of iron yet they bend under the weight of this inn's meager offerings and the handle breaks on me tankard to spill this rat spit of an ale into my lap! Aarrr, Nessie, get me another!~
@18622 = ~Lots of walls, everywhere they are. No room to breathe. No room to breathe. They said paid excellent wages they did. Didn't say anything about little holes did they. No, spaces too small they are. Spaces too small.~
@18623 = ~Um... are you okay?~
@18624 = ~We'll just leave you alone.~
@18625 = ~What? Don't you see the walls? Walls everywhere. No room to breathe. No room to breathe. They said paid excellent wages they did. Didn't say anything about little holes did they. No, spaces too small they are. Spaces too small.~
@18626 = ~Bye bye then.~
@18627 = ~Yes, ram your eyeball onto this blade to see if it be cursed with this metal weakness, too... Aarrr, ne'ermind, they'll just kick me out of this place and send me amongst the very brigands who might covet me rotten tankard!~
@18628 = ~Finally! Someone has come to save us.~
@18629 = ~Do you know something about what's been happening here?~
@18630 = ~Sure I know what's happening. What do you wanna know?~
@18631 = ~I can see your grubby face reflected in the bottom of me tankard, now leave me be.~
@18632 = ~What about the missing miners?~
@18633 = ~Have you heard about any creatures in the mines?~
@18634 = ~What about the ore?~
@18635 = ~Oh them, I told them before they went. Tried to at least. Naturally there must be a dragon down there killing them all. He must be mad about us mining his hill. Poor thing.	~
@18636 = ~Just the dragon is all. Haven't actually seen him, but what else could kill all those miners.~
@18637 = ~Oh, we don't ship as much out as we used to. We do pretty well considering the shortage of people we have to help though.~
@18638 = ~Ah, a new face in this cloistered place. Stand by my side and let's talk for a while.~
@18639 = ~What brings you here, traveler?~
@18640 = ~No thanks, I'm not feeling talkative today.~
@18641 = ~A visitor! Oh glorious day. We don't get many down here as you can imagine. Are you going to be going down into the mines? If so could you return this dagger to Kylee? He dropped it when he went into the mine the other day and haven't seen him since.~
@18642 = ~Sure, I'll return his dagger.~
@18643 = ~Sorry, I've got more important things to do.~
@18644 = ~Thank you so much. I'm sure he'll appreciate it.~
@18645 = ~Well, that's fine. Being an adventurer and all, you probably don't have the time to waste.~
@18646 = ~I was an apprentice blacksmith under Taerom Fuiruim in Beregost. With the iron situation being what it is, however, I thought I'd better head somewhere else. Waterdeep, maybe. Taerom's having enough trouble making a go of it as it is...~
@18647 = ~Hey there again, I hope everything's gone fine for ya.~
@18648 = ~I can't believe I lost my dagger. Hey there! You're more adventurers huh? My name's Kylee, and I gotta say it's good to have some armed people down here. Well I hope you do better than the last bunch. Gods be damned, I lost my dagger, and with all that's been going on, I feel kinda naked without it.~
@18649 = ~You have my dagger? Thank you so much, I was getting nervous down here being unarmed, with all the things going on.~
@18650 = ~What do you know about the happenings of the mine?~
@18651 = ~Kobolds! They're overrunning the place piece by piece. We used to see them occasionally but now you can't go more than a few feet without kicking one of them on the lower levels. It's not so bad up here with the guards around. Still, I wouldn't get caught in the dark if I were you.~
@18652 = ~Hey... wait... please wait. You've gotta help me, they're after me. They'll be here soon.~
@18653 = ~Calm down. Tell us what's going on and we'll see if we can help you.~
@18654 = ~Understandable. The roads have been rough and it's probably a good time to lay down a few coins for a room.~
@18655 = ~Get outta here gnome, we don't need you bothering us.~
@18656 = ~No one will help me... -sob-...~
@18657 = ~They're kobolds; dozens of them! They captured me and stripped me down. The dirty imps tortured me for no other reason other than to hear me scream! But... I got away... they'll be here soon... we have to run... get out of here!~
@18658 = ~Oh no... it's too late: they're here!~
@18659 = ~Hi, come well and welcome! You have stumbled upon the Great Gazib Show, starring yours truly, the Great Gazib!!! Allow me to introduce the Amazing Oopah, the world's only exploding ogre!~
@18660 = ~You there! Stop!~
@18661 = ~Sorry to bother you, but you should be aware of the danger you're in right now. There are monsters about; dog-headed ones. I'd advise that you return to Nashkel where it's safe.~
@18662 = ~The Amazing Oopah~
@18663 = ~The Amazing Oopah~
@18664 = ~Thank you; we appreciate the warning.~
@18665 = ~Actually, we're adventurers. We're here to help out. Perhaps you could tell us about what's been going on in the region.~
@18666 = ~Good day to you.~
@18667 = ~We could sure use some more fighting men. If you want to know where to go, just go to the northwest. Up there is the mines. Emerson might tell you that he don't need any adventurers, but you don't listen to him. We need as many men as we can get.~
@18668 = ~EXPORT CHARACTER~
@18669 = ~Fun for the whole family! Now, let's try that crowd-pleaser one more time.~
@18670 = ~Anything else?~
@18671 = ~Thanks for the help.~
@18672 = ~You're either a die-hard fan or a sadist, friend... (No, Oopah, just one more, one last one, then you can go back to the tent... Oopah, put the weapon down... Oopah?) AAaeee!~
@18673 = ~Well, ya, there's this crazy guy. I think he calls himself Prism. He's been making a sculpture in a cliff side. Kind of a kook if you ask me. I'll see you later then.~
@18674 = ~Oh, how dreadfully unposh you all are! I mean, honestly, this is a carnival, not a gladiator's ring...~
@18675 = ~Kylee's Dagger~
@18676 = ~Lord Binky the Buffoon~
@18677 = ~Lord Binky the Buffoon~
@18678 = ~You're here to kill me! JAMIE!! They're here to kill me! Get out of the closet Jamie. Save me!!!~
@18679 = ~Hmmph! Good, and don't come back!~
@18680 = ~Adventurers! Wow, have you come to clear out the mines at Nashkel? I hear there's all sorts of monsters there.~
@18681 = ~Mon namen est <CHARNAME>, vott iss yorse?~
@18682 = ~What a fahbulous carnival, dahling!~
@18683 = ~Ho, you'll not get away with that for long!~
@18684 = ~Are you mocking me?~
@18685 = ~Ho, you'll not get away with that for long!~
@18686 = ~Are you mocking me?~
@18687 = ~Ho, ye'll not git away wit' dat fer long!~
@18688 = ~Dost thou mockest me? Away with you, beggar!~
@18689 = ~Okay, now that's enough!~
@18690 = ~That's it, you got this one coming, kid!~
@18691 = ~Hokey-dokey, like dat's enuff now, eh?~
@18692 = ~Who are you? What are you doing in my room?~
@18693 = ~Eeek! Run for your lives! Run for your lives!~
@18694 = ~That's it! You are dead meat!~
@18695 = ~We're hired killers. We're here to kill you, now just be silent and we'll quietly slit your throat.~
@18696 = ~That's it! You are dead meat!~
@18697 = ~What a fahbulous carnival, dahling...~
@18698 = ~We're adventurers, just arrived in town recently. So what's your name?~
@18699 = ~My name's <CHARNAME>, what's yours?~
@18700 = ~What a fabulous carnival!~
@18701 = ~Sorry for bothering you, we'll be out of your room right away.~
@18702 = ~...and there she lay, pale and bloodless at my side!
    Woeful be the path of the elves, said I.
    Woeful be the path of all who trod this glade,
    for Nosferatu's once-fair love—
         has died, oh she has died...~
@18703 = ~Monsters at the mines, eh? Well perhaps we'll have to check that out. Thanks.~
@18704 = ~We're not here to talk about monsters, we're here to see you. What's your name?~
@18705 = ~Maybe I'll see you later. Bye.~
@18706 = ~...'midst coffers full and coffins bare,
    there came the fearsome devil-bat!
    Red blood, red eyes, and ruddy hair
    but none more red
         than two sharp teeth that glistened there...~
@18707 = ~Well... my name's Samantha. I... uh... I wonder why you would want to see me; I'm nothing special.~
@18708 = ~You got that one right. See you later.~
@18709 = ~You're a very pretty woman, Samantha. We've heard talk about you all over town. We just wanted to come up here and see if it was true.~
@18710 = ~Why you rude... get out of my room! Get out!~
@18711 = ~There ends Galahynne's last and best-loved work, "Nosferatu." Enjoy the rest of the carnival, ladies and gentlemen. A finer one I have not seen in years...~
@18712 = ~That's really nice of you to say, but I know why you're really up here, and you won't get away with it! JAMIE!! Get out of the closet. It's not mom and dad, it's a bunch of brigands. They're gonna hurt me. Haaaalp!!!~
@18713 = ~What are you guys up to!? You step away from my girl. Lecherous brigands, if you think you can lay a hand on Samantha and live, you don't know who you're dealing with. I've trained with the guard for a good two years, and I think I'm a little more than a match for the likes of you.~
@18714 = ~Hey there! Who told ya that ya could come in here! This place is only for members of the Amnian soldiery. Little snot-noses like you, you're not welcome here. Come on, get outta here 'fore I have to kick your butts.~
@18715 = ~~
@18716 = ~Hey, I'm sorry. We didn't know that this was the barracks. We'll get out right now, okay?~
@18717 = ~Who the hell do you think you are trying to push us around! I don't think you know who you're dealing with. Shut up and get lost before we have to hurt you.~
@18718 = ~Sure is a nice carnival they put on... If only there were more people here to enjoy it...~
@18719 = ~Good, run off with yer tails between your legs. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have important business. Get outta my way!~
@18720 = ~Ahhh... sorry 'bout yelling at ya. I didn't mean nothing from it. I'll just be going now, 'kay?~
@18721 = ~Where is everyone?~
@18722 = ~What's your favorite act?~
@18723 = ~Down in the mines or dead... A combination of the two, more often than not... I'm sorry, you folks are here to enjoy the carnival. Don't let me go telling my depressing tales.~
@18724 = ~Yes, well uh... it's been nice meeting you.~
@18725 = ~The mines interest us more than the carnival, to be honest. We'd like to figure out what's wrong if we can.~
@18726 = ~Enjoy the carnival, folks...~
@18727 = ~What's right? That place has been claiming lives hand over fist but where else can we find work? It's either death by the demons or death by the dinner plate, and us Nashkel folk aren't the type to let our families starve. I'd register with the garrison but with this bum leg, I ain't no good at fighting. Just pushin' the ore barrow, that's all.~
@18728 = ~You there, stay back!! IF any of you come any closer, I'll kill her. I'm serious. Don't make me do it. All I have to do is say the last word of my spell and she'll die.~
@18729 = ~Cure Critical Wounds (Necromancy)
Level: 5
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Creature Touched
Saving Throw: None
The cure critical wounds spell is a very potent version of the cure light wounds spell. The priest lays his hands upon a creature and heals 27 points of damage from wounds or other injuries. The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those not living.~
@18730 = ~My wife's a fan of the guy performing Galahynne's "Nosferatu" but I'll take the Great Gazib's exploding ogre any day...~
@18731 = ~What's this all about?~
@18732 = ~Don't tell me what to do, bozo. Step aside before you get hurt.~
@18733 = ~I told you, but you wouldn't listen! Now she dies, and then you die!

Arashaka!~
@18734 = ~She's a witch. She'll use her magics to poison the children of this town. She'll butcher the livestock and she'll seduce the young men, make them her puppets. She must be killed!~
@18735 = ~What's going on? You're not our captors...~
@18736 = ~No, we're not. Make your way to the surface and flee while there's still time. We'll take care of the remaining guards down here.~
@18737 = ~No, we're not. What is this place and who is keeping you here in these foul conditions?~
@18738 = ~What are you talking about? Why the prejudice against a magic user? You said it yourself that you're a mage. After all, aren't you going to kill her with your "magic word?" Get a hold of yourself, you idiot.~
@18739 = ~I thank you, stranger, with every ounce of strength that is left in me. I haven't seen the light of day for well nigh a year.~
@18740 = ~Why don't we discuss this like rational beings? Just calm down and I'm sure we can come to some sane solution.~
@18741 = ~Davaeorn the Mage, he has enslaved us here and forced us to live like rats in these filthy dens and warrens. And for what? To mine iron as if it were the last thing left in the bowels of the Realms. I would tear his very head from his shoulders, had I the power.~
@18742 = ~Stop threatening the woman, you psycho. Step aside before you get hurt.~
@18743 = ~Are you mocking me! No one mocks the great Zordral. You will pay for your insolence!~
@18744 = ~Discuss! There is nothing to discuss. This witch will die! Now leave me, or I'll smite you as well.~
@18745 = ~I cannot speak with you further. I can feel Davaeorn breathing down my neck.~
@18746 = ~Are you some sort of inbred hedge wizard? I really don't believe you can cast any spells at all. Come on, moron, if you're a wizard you should be able to "smite" us down where we stand.~
@18747 = ~If it's a fight you want, then you'll get one.~
@18748 = ~Come on, we can't just let you murder a defenseless woman. Just calm down and let's talk.~
@18749 = ~There are two reasons I pound this pick against these rocks. Do you wish to hear them?~
@18750 = ~Defenseless woman! She's a witch! She's dangerous, and must be killed. Get away from me, before I kill you all.~
@18751 = ~Yes, I would.~
@18752 = ~Okay, that's it, you idiot. We've had it with your theatrics. If you were a real mage, by now you would have blasted us to pieces. Obviously you're nothing but a fake, a fraud, a huckster!~
@18753 = ~I have no patience for the prattle of slaves, be they mine or mine enemy's.~
@18754 = ~First, because I imagine this rock to be my captor's skull. Second, because the meager spark that leaps from my attempt is all the light I'll ever know again. If you be a new slave like I once was, you shall learn these simple truths soon enough.~
@18755 = ~Sorry, but we can't let you hurt the lady. We're going to have to remove you by force if need be.~
@18756 = ~Then I have come upon a third...~
@18757 = ~Thank you for rescuing me. I am Bentha, and yes you could call me a witch, for I do use magic. However, I have no intentions of killing the livestock or "seducing" the young men. Zordral is an old enemy of mine, one who has caused me and my family great pain over the years. If you had not walked in at that moment, I would have been killed. I must thank you again. Is there anything that I can do to help you?~
@18758 = ~I was a bard, once. I knew every song that ever was and I could sing them all so beautifully. But now my throat's been choked by dust and my lungs have withered in this chilly air. A thousand curses on Davaeorn and whatever man it was that hired him!~
@18759 = ~Guards! Guards! Andarsson's speaking ill of Davaeorn... Wait! You're no guards... Aaah... Guards! Guards!~
@18760 = ~Do you have any magic trinkets you might be able to give us?~
@18761 = ~Do you have information about the region? We're adventurers, and would be grateful if you could give us any advice.~
@18762 = ~No, a good deed done is enough for us.~
@18763 = ~Why yes I do. Here, take this. It might come in useful in times of need. It's a potion that cures all poisons.~
@18764 = ~Well, I'm not too knowledgeable about the Nashkel region, but I do know that Volothamp Geddarm is staying at the tavern in Nashkel. That man knows everything. He knows more than a mortal man should know.~
@18765 = ~Why, that's very kind of you. But I couldn't let you leave without a small parting gift. Here take this. It's a potion that will help in any heroic endeavors.~
@18766 = ~Psst— there be a plug somewhere that seals this mine from the river's torrent. Find it and maybe you can render this hell no more than a watery memory of its former self.~
@18767 = ~Where is this plug you speak of?~
@18768 = ~This the only mine between Baldur's Gate and Amn that is still producing valid ore, however horrible its method. Much as I would love to flood these fetid walls, we might yet need more than memories of this place.~
@18769 = ~I know not, only that Davaeorn is said to have the key upon his person at all times.~
@18770 = ~Good day travelers. Mmmm... Edwin, I did not expect to see you so soon. I hope your... business has been attended to Edwin, for if it hasn't, then you should do so soon. I think that Zulkir Nevron would be most disappointed if he were to hear that you failed. That is all that really needs to be said. Good day again, and goodbye.~
@18771 = ~And what of Nashkel? Is their ore not still light and strong? Fie, I can tell by your face that I have been entombed within this grave too long! My world has staggered on without me...~
@18772 = ~Greetings Faldorn. I see that you have made some new friends. Well I hope your crusade against the Iron Throne goes well. Well I shouldn't bother you for too long. On your way now Faldorn, and know that Laskal watches over you. Before you go, a word of advice. Watch for the druid known as Seniyad, he could give you trouble. You know how the other orders view our methods.~
@18773 = ~Stop where you are and state your names!~
@18774 = ~You there! I command you to stop, so that I might parley with you a moment.~
@18775 = ~I am <CHARNAME> and this is my party of fellow adventurers.~
@18776 = ~You have no need to know our names. Indeed, I would appreciate it if you would tell us yours.~
@18777 = ~We don't have time for you, old-timer.~
@18778 = ~What is your purpose here?~
@18779 = ~Who are you? What is it that you want with us?~
@18780 = ~We have heard rumors of wyverns hereabout.~
@18781 = ~You might not have the time for me, but I certainly have the time for you. I must assume that you are part of the organization that pollutes the Cloakwood. For that, you must die.~
@18782 = ~We hear there is an Iron Throne presence in these woods and are here to investigate it.~
@18783 = ~My name is Laskal, and I am the protector of the Cloakwood. I would ask you a question before I take my leave of you. I have a message for those that serve the Iron Throne. Would you be a representative of that organization?~
@18784 = ~Wyverns?~
@18785 = ~Yes. With fearsome fangs and enough poison in their tails to kill a horse ten times over.~
@18786 = ~Oh, there's no reason to worry. They're quite territorial and if you haven't encountered them yet, you're probably quite safe.~
@18787 = ~Uh, excuse me, I have some pressing business to attend to elsewhere.~
@18788 = ~Why, yes we are. Hand over the message.~
@18789 = ~Indeed. Well, I assure you there are none over this way, then, for we have been encamped here for some time.~
@18790 = ~We have no connection to that evil group. We are sworn enemies of the Iron Throne.~
@18791 = ~You are mistaken, I did not mean to give you a written message, but rather a verbal one. Know that the Iron Throne's time within this wood is ending. The Shadow Druids will no longer sit about and let them pollute this forest. You will be our first example of what happens to those who defile nature!~
@18792 = ~Well, I'm afraid we don't welcome visitors. Men, set upon them at once!~
@18793 = ~Mmmmm. An enemy of an enemy is a friend. My earlier question was just a test. I am glad to know that you also oppose this organization. They have been a blight on these woods ever since they re-opened the ancient dwarven iron mine. Well, I am glad to know you. Take this, hopefully it will aid you against the Iron Throne. The Iron Throne's fort is located to the east.~
@18794 = ~I am Lakadaar of the Iron Throne and these are my men. Sadly, that information will not leave this grove. Set upon them, men, and let none escape to spread word of our presence here.~
@18795 = ~Ho there, watch your step on the wharves, hereabouts. The sea spray can make the cobbles a touch treacherous... My name is Kerrachus. Is there anything I can help you with?~
@18796 = ~You shouldn't have broken into my master's home. Master Jardak will be quite displeased when he learns that ruffians have disturbed the order of his house.~
@18797 = ~What do you do here?~
@18798 = ~Who the hell are you, and why are you dressed in such silly colors?~
@18799 = ~I've never seen such a big city!~
@18800 = ~Tell you master Jardak that we want to talk to him right away.~
@18801 = ~Aye, I be the Dukes' own dockhand, if you will... Well, alright, I'm just a dockhand like any other but I've been aboard the royal galleys to unload wares from the New World.~
@18802 = ~We'll be leaving now. Sorry if we made a mess, but I'm sure you won't be that hard up to just clean up after us.~
@18803 = ~My name is Drelik. But really, my name, or the clothes I choose to wear are of no consequence. Of consequence here, is that you have broken into my master's house and made a mess. I think I'll have to clean up the mess... permanently.~
@18804 = ~A "New World"? Is there some sort of dimensional portal in the middle of the sea through which you pass to get there?~
@18805 = ~Jardak will not see anyone... especially not a bunch of hooligans. Well, lest I seem rude, I had better introduce myself. My name is Drelik. Now that you know my name, I can guiltlessly go about the task of cleaning up the mess you've made, which incidentally includes removing you from the premises.~
@18806 = ~Well, you shall always have the title of Dockhand to the Dukes in my mind, Kerrachus. Alas, I cannot tarry here. Perhaps we'll talk another day.~
@18807 = ~'Tis better yet! They say now that the world is no longer flat, that it has become round, a perfect sphere wrapped 'round itself like a wizard's crystal. We perch atop its upright half and the New World of Maztica clings to its underside like so many bats! Someday I shall sneak aboard one of these ships that I might see such wonders!~
@18808 = ~Oh no! You won't be leaving now... not after the mess you've made. My master has given specific instructions that anyone who breaks into his dwelling is not to go anywhere... ever again.~
@18809 = ~Your New World is no hero's quest but rather a blind fool's errand. I have read that between the brutality of the Flaming Fist and the witless terror of Amn, your precious New World has been coated with the blood of its innocents ten times over!~
@18810 = ~What have you done! My butler wouldn't have let you up here... unless you killed him. Pathetic wretches, do you know what you have done? Your screams will echo in Hell for all eternity for your insolence!~
@18811 = ~Your ravings breathe with more fantasy than fact! I will stick to my theories of dimensions and portals for, if nothing else, they contain a greater potential for truth than your fictions!~
@18812 = ~Hey, hold on mister. It was your butler who attacked us! We just defended ourselves. If you're going to have hired help, make sure that you get someone a little smarter next time.~
@18813 = ~Who are you, and where did you get that cool armor. Hmmm, at least you have better fashion sense than your butler.~
@18814 = ~You don't understand the gravity of your situation. Stinking brigands, draw steel so that we might fight to the death!~
@18815 = ~Aye, the New World's conquerors may be fools but its historians shall be wiser. Regardless of how red run the rivers now, the pages of history shall read only as we write them: rivers pristine and blue and a lush and open continent void of all inhabitants... Therein lies the secret strength of empires: they can afford the folly of constructed memories.~
@18816 = ~modify characters~
@18817 = ~Nothing changes with as much rapidity and stealth as the iron truths of science...~
@18818 = ~If I haven't stowed myself away in the hold of one of these ships in your absence, that is.~
@18819 = ~True, but they say Waterdeep to the North is even ten times the size. I hope to sail there, someday, and rest awhile in its bustling port.~
@18820 = ~Greetings! I can tell by the way you look about you that you are new to the city. For a mere 15 pieces of gold, I can tell you of the glorious history that once coursed through the weighted veins of this metropolis.~
@18821 = ~I am in no mood to pay 15 gp for a trip down boredom lane. Now away and be done with you.~
@18822 = ~Please do. Such a tale would be well worth the price of admission.~
@18823 = ~Rather provincial of you to state it in such a manner, might I suggest? Nevertheless, it shall be precisely as you wish it. Goodbye.~
@18824 = ~Ah, yes, the city as we know it today falls in the shape of a plump and crescent moon. Its many wharves and docks jut out along its western point where the River Chionthar flows into the starry Sea of Swords. A bridge from this western shore links the mainland with a rocky islet on which perches the old, massive Seatower of Balduran. It is there that the true tale begins. Do you wish me to continue?~
@18825 = ~Yes, please.~
@18826 = ~No thank you, I'm starting to get bored already.~
@18827 = ~Balduran was a well-known and good-natured pirate who sailed the Sea of Swords in times gone by. He built the Seatower that bears his name to guide him to his home port and provide warning of invasion to his kin and clan that made their home along the northern riverbank. In time, a vibrant group of traders and fellow sea captains gathered there and built the city's inner wall to protect their wares and belongings from the ever-present danger or rival pirates or orcish raids... You look distracted. Do you still wish me to continue?~
@18828 = ~Certainly! I wouldn't have it any other way.~
@18829 = ~-yawn- Oh my, was I sleeping? Perhaps it would be better if you leave me be...~
@18830 = ~Balduran was away from port during the time in which the decision to build the wall was made and, when he returned, he learned that many of his kin and clan now lay outside the new wall and vulnerable to any attack made upon the settlement! As the orcs advanced upon the city in the early summer, it erupted into a state of civil chaos. It was at this point that Balduran's sails were spotted upon the horizon, returning home to port... Ahem, are you still with me?~

Together, they ordered the immediate construction of the city's outer wall, and bridge gate from which Baldur's Gate gets its name. Facing a united city and a stout defense, the orcs were defeated and, for their valor, Balduran appointed the four captains as Dukes of the city... Well, that's Baldur's Gate in a nutshell. I'm quite impressed with your perseverence.~

@18836 = ~Well, there's really not that much more to tell... Balduran eventually died (apparently lost at sea) and the four Dukes passed on their titles in a hereditary fashion for many years. Now, of course, Dukes are elected to office, although they keep the title until their death. They have grown softer and more tolerant over the years, however, and I think many people would like to see someone with a more extravagant, forceful approach ascend to the position. But that is the future, not the past, and who knows what it shall hold.~

Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using his shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield. Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from three to four feet in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a spread dragon's wings. A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward.

@19267 = ~You do not dream often, but tonight the visions are vivid indeed. Long have you walked, but now you find yourself back amidst the stones of Candlekeep. Your former home looms before you, but the gate is closed and barred. Over the walls there is a candle in your old room, but as the light goes out, the brick surrounding the window closes together. The very walls conspire to keep you at bay.

A familiar voice startles you, though it is calm and caring. "You cannot go back this way, child. You must go on." Gorion forms before you, and though his image should be comforting, it seems but a shade of his living self. He is dead in your dreams, as in life.

The phantom of your foster father gestures towards the blackness of the wood as though it should be inviting. Perhaps it is, in a way, but the traveling will be hard. As you think this, a smooth and obvious path becomes clear out the corner of your eye. It seems meant for you, pulls at your very being, and promises to quickly lead you away from the life you once led. Perhaps this would be for the best, but it is a bit too convenient for your liking. You do not wish to dwell upon the loss you have endured, but neither should it be forgotten. Gorion smiles, and fades away.

The pull becomes a push, but you turn away, steadfast in your new direction. The way is not quite as clear, but it is sure to be interesting nonetheless. A whisper follows as you stride away, something vestigial and sinister that you recognize, but yet have never heard. "You will learn..."

You don't look back.~ [DREAM1G]
@19268 = ~You do not dream often, but tonight the visions are vivid indeed. Long have you walked, but now you find yourself back amidst the stones of Candlekeep. Your former home looms before you, the drab walls just as you remember them. Over the barricades you can see your old room, and you wonder if it really was as small as it appears now.

As you stand before the keep, a familiar figure comes into view. Gorion stands before you, but his visage is shadowy and weak. He is dead in your dreams, as in life.

The phantom of your foster father mutely walks towards the woods, towards supposed safety, and beckons for you to follow as he did once before. This time you remain behind, knowing what is to come.

Before your eyes, phantoms of the past re-enact the pathetic scene that must have taken place in your absence. Clad in armor assuredly magical, a figure strides from the darkness. Admittedly a powerful mage in his youth, Gorion is all but helpless before the onslaught. As he falls, the scene begins again, replaying over and over. Each successive viewing makes the unknown warrior all the more impressive.

As you stare at the murderer of your former mentor, one thought coalesces in your mind: you will have such power as this. Whatever it takes, you will have all that he does, and more. With that, a passage becomes clear through the darkened wood, and you wonder how you could have missed it. The trees close behind you as you walk, but you are unconcerned. The path feels right, and will assuredly give you what you seek. It seems to promise this in a voice you know, but yet have never heard.

The image of Gorion's death replays in your mind throughout the night.

You get used to it.~ [DREAM1E]
@19269 = ~You are startled out of sleep with a chill, though the night is warm and calm. It is as though someone has walked across your grave, and for a moment you wonder if it was you. With this thought the ground beneath you opens and you are swept into the dark.

When light returns, you do not find its presence comforting. Before you lay the empty mines of Nashkel, cleansed by your previous passage. You move through walls and floors alike, descending deeper and deeper, until a bloated figure comes into view. Mulahey, in no better shape than you left him, stands motionless before you.

Held from whatever afterlife calls it, this foul apparition has been waiting for you. A dagger of bone hovers before it, ready for a willing hand to drive it deep. Had this creature breath you are sure it would be hurling curses. It waits for the kill, a death beyond death, and knows no hope.

You turn your back on the blade, and it clatters to the floor. Punishment enough shall find this creature in the land of the dead; you need not inflict any more upon him.

Surprised and thankful, the visage of Mulahey hobbles forward and through you, off to whatever fate it deserves. Perhaps for safekeeping, it leaves a part of itself behind. It is a spark of hope that fills a space within you; a dagger-shaped hole you did not know was empty.

There is a cry of rage from the depths, and the dagger of bone launches itself though the air, your heart its target. You awake just as it should have struck, and the cold sweat that covers you stings your eyes. A disapproving voice lingers in your ears, though it should have disappeared with the dream. "You... WILL... Learn!"~ [DREAM2G]
@19270 = ~The stone tunnels of the Nashkel mines constrain your dreams tonight. The twisting depths are more a nuisance than claustrophobic now, what with the hidden marauders dead at your feet. Deeper you tread, chuckling over your triumph at each body you see, pausing occasionally to wipe your boots clean or check the odd kobold for coins you might have missed.

There is a sound from below and you quickly move towards it. A door opens and before you stands Mulahey in no better shape than you left him. Held from whatever afterlife calls it, this specter has apparently been waiting for you. A dagger of bone hovers before it, ready for a willing hand to drive it deep. Had this creature breath you are sure it would be hurling curses. It waits for the kill, a death beyond death, and knows no hope. Rightfully so.

You brush aside the quaint blade and bring your hands around the creature's neck. A stranger's weapon simply will not suffice in this matter; you must be certain this phantom remains among the dead. It is strange though; doomed as he is, Mulahey still looks somewhat relieved. His visage fades within your grasp and leaves you clutching at empty air. A puzzling turn, but of little concern. The mine is yours once again.

You turn to leave, but find the exit blocked. The lone dagger has become five: a skeletal set of claws that hovers before you. A talon extends and presses against your chest, and a hollow voice chills the air. "You should use the tools you are given." It traces a line of ichor on your tunic, increasing in pressure. "Listen to what is bred in the bone." There is a flash of motion as the claws push deep into your chest.

You awake in an instant, the sound of morning a welcome clamor. You are intact and, though tired, you are certainly not afraid.

Your heart is not your weak spot.~ [DREAM2E]
@19271 = ~As darkness falls, your mind drifts back to events past, and to triumphs well deserved indeed. A fortified camp secluded and guarded from the entire coast, and it is naught but easy pickings before your guile. All manner of bandit and brigand move about here, but you may as well be invisible amongst them.

Your recollections are interrupted by a powerful gust of wind, lifting you high above the camp and woods both. Your arc crests in the high morning sun, and for a moment you are as a bird, free from your duties to those below. With unseen hands the earth reasserts her hold on you, and suddenly you feel less like a sparrow and more like a catapult stone.

Without impact or fanfare, the ground accepts your passage and does not strike back. In a moment all is black, and for all you know you have descended to the very core of the world. The rock around you illuminates and a cavern slowly takes shape, though you can see no more than a few steps ahead or behind. Stumbling forward you find yourself face to face with... yourself.

Before you is a likeness in stone exact to the smallest detail. A voice in the darkness accuses you, even as it seems amused. "Such pride undeserved, great predator, when your whole being is borrowed. Credit where it is due, and dues where payment is demanded."

A dagger of bone flies from the blackness and strikes the statue, square. It cracks slightly, but the pain you feel is as though you were rent asunder.

"You were made as you are," taunts the voice, "and you can also be broken." You fall backward into the void, and do not come to rest until morning wakes you.~ [DREAM3G]
@19272 = ~A woman is being held captive in the gnoll fortress to the west! It seems likely that she is still alive as her captors apparently banished the gnoll, Ingot, upon well-founded suspicions that he might eat her.~
@19273 = ~As darkness falls, your mind drifts back to events past, and to conquests well won indeed. The feared and fabled bandits that have plagued the entire coast are as dust beneath you. You stride through their camp ignoring their attacks, and scattering tents and bodies as you go.

Your recollections are interrupted without impact or fanfare, as the earth opens to accept your passage. The cascading rock and gravel prevents your escape, and in a moment all is black. For all you know you have descended to the very core of the world.

@19274 = ~Tonight you dream of blood. Not of blood on a blade or the blood on your hands, but an ichor that runs as a torrent through the Realms. A flood that pours across the fields and forests. An ocean that floats you to the world's edge, and threatens to cascade off into the void.

This blood seems a frightening thing: a massive force that sweeps away all resistance. As a whole it is a monster and it cannot be stopped. Were it to be viewed from on high, it would seem to cover the entire world in its red-black embrace.

You, however, do not have such a lofty perch. From within the deluge you can see it does not move as one, but is filled with currents, eddies, and undertows. Pockets of calm afford breathing space, whilst violent whirlpools threaten to rend limb from limb. Ultimately it seems undirected, and lacks a driving will, a quality you have in abundance. You may be caught within, but sufficient determination can shape what you need to survive. There are still options open; still choices to be made.

As the tide presses forward you steer as you wish, atop a ship called Persistence and under sails made of resolve.

A sudden and deliberate wave puts an end to your course, and to the dream. It would seem that the flood does have some will, and took offence to your enjoying the ride.~ [DREAM4G]

@19276 = ~You close your eyes tonight, and visions of Candlekeep swim into view. As you pass through the gates of the citadel there is a flash of memory, and you are a child of only a few seasons once more. At your side is Gorion, gray-haired even all those years ago. How old must he have been to age so little in the time since?

Aged as he ever was, you still have to run to keep up with him. He has an important meeting with Ulraunt, the Keeper of the Tomes: an important meeting about you. Funny, you don't remember it.

As you stand outside the doors of the inner keep you can hear the shouting from within. Gorion seldom raised his voice, though you did not care to listen to the "discussions" at your previous stops either.

As you trace patterns in the water of a fountain, a reflection distracts you from the argument. A large raven has perched atop a stone wall, and stares directly at you with huge black eyes. You stare back through the mirror of the water, and are suddenly afraid to meet the bird's gaze any other way. It has claws for feet you think to yourself: little skeletal claws.

The doors of the keep suddenly swing open and Ulraunt storms out. He glances at you for a moment, but looks away as he speaks. "You both can stay," he sneers, "but mark my words: That child will be the death of you."

A flash of memory once more, and Gorion walks out of the keep as he is today: dead. You drop your gaze back to the water so as not to see. The raven is gone, but your own image remains. Your eyes are black, like those of a bird.

"Like father, like child" the reflection says.

You wake with a yell, predictably unrested.~ [DREAM5G]
@19277 = ~Today I met the madman, Kissiq. He seems quite obsessed and disturbed by his supposed encounter with a talking chicken. While I doubt his sanity, I find the lure of such adventure rather hard to suppress. He claimed that the chicken lay to the east of him, should I ever choose to investigate this further.~
@19278 = ~You close your eyes tonight, and Candlekeep winds its way into your dreams. With a flash of memory you are a runt of a child once more, Gorion dragging you through the gates of the citadel. Aged as he ever was, you still have to run to keep up with him. He has an important meeting with Ulraunt, the Keeper of the Tomes: an important meeting about you. Funny, you don't remember it.

As you stand outside the doors of the inner keep you can hear the shouting from within. Gorion is uncharacteristically loud, and seems quite irate. You don't know why he bothers, really. No one seems to want the two of you around.

As you skip stones in the fountains of the courtyard, a reflection distracts you from the argument. A large raven has perched atop a stone wall, and stares directly at you with huge black eyes.

@19279 = ~Tonight you sleep hunted by all, and wake in a dream hunted by one.

Tonight you are the monster everyone claims you are; the kobold scorned like a rodent; the ogre that children fear comes in the night. The mobs and their torches now come for you, counting you among the creatures you once did hunt. Or so someone would have you believe.

Once again you hear the voice; a voice that now makes no secret of its origins. It speaks of destiny and nature, and of evils bred in the bone. It says you will never be free of the mob; that they will hunt you for what you are. Murder and death run through your heart and accepting that will supposedly give you power. The essence of Bhaal within you cannot be ignored.

But you have not ignored it. You realize that from the first you have fought the very blood in your veins, fought dagger and claw for each victory, and ultimately you have triumphed. With righteous will, you have turned the dark forces within you to good purpose. Whatever the foundation of your being, you have remade yourself in your own image.

Amidst threats it does not yet know are empty, the voice tries to play upon your doubts, but finds none. As you stare unwavering, the presence grows weaker and weaker. As it fades from your mind, one warning does stand out amidst the din. It speaks of others that will listen where you have not, others that will embrace what you have rejected, and others that will be your death. This describes but one man, and you know of no other it could be. He who orchestrated your fall, deceived your comrades, and deserves all that your justice shall mete upon him. Sarevok.

His is a debt that must be paid to the whole of the Sword Coast. You awake sure of your cause, and of what must be done.~ [DREAM6G]
@19280 = ~Tonight you sleep hunted by all, and wake in a dream hunted by one.

Tonight you are the monster everyone claims you are; the kobold scorned like a rodent; the ogre that children fear comes in the night. The mobs and their torches now come for you, counting you among the creatures you once did hunt. Or so someone would have you believe.

Once again you hear the voice; a voice that now makes no secret of its origins. It speaks of destiny and nature, and of evils bred in the bone. It says you will never be free of the mob; that they will hunt you for what you are. Murder and death run in your veins and accepting that will supposedly give you power. The essence of Bhaal within you cannot be ignored.

It is mistaken. You have already accepted what runs in your veins: you have accepted it and moved on. Whatever the foundation of the blood within you, it is yours and no one else's. If there is power to be had, then you will administer it as you see fit, and not according to the ravings of a shade long dead.

You calmly turn your back and walk away, applying the most powerful weapon you have at your disposal: indifference. Let the dead rattle on if they wish. Had they the power to harm you they would have done so a dozen times over. More tangible threats require attention.

The voice becomes shrill and piercing as you walk, but gradually grows weaker. As it fades, one warning does stand out amidst the din. It speaks of others that will listen where you have not, others that will embrace what you have rejected, and others that will be your death. This describes but one man, and you know of no other it could be. He who orchestrated your fall, and deserves all that you shall inflict upon him. Sarevok.

He shall feel your wrath for all that has occurred. You awake sure of your cause, and of what must be done.~ [DREAM6E]
@19281 = ~Sarevok crumbles to dust before you, as did his elaborate scheme. The walls still echo his anger, but you know that the influence he wielded is finally gone. His treachery will affect the Sword Coast for some time to come, but the region will eventually return to what it calls "normal."

There has been a more permanent effect upon you, however.

You and Sarevok shared more than you would care to know. You were of the same blood, the same lineage, and the poison that ran through his heart has the potential to take yours as well. You have heard the whispers of the past, as your sibling must have, but you chose to shut them out. While it is hard to imagine the towering Sarevok as weak, despite his menacing nature he succumbed to the dark temptations that you have not.

The whispers may yet become screams, however, and there is danger that remains real. For you, and the rest of the Realms alike.

Would Sarevok have become a god if his plans had reached fruition? It is unlikely. At least, not in the manner he would have wished. Sarevok caused great suffering in the name of his father, but somehow you know that his untimely death has perhaps served the dead god more. As you watched the essence of your sibling drain away, a horrible scenario emerged in your mind. This child; raised to madness, driven to conquest, ultimately killed by those that would righteously oppose him; his entire life was nothing more than "fuel" for the eventual rebirth of the father. Bhaal seeded the world with offspring to effect his resurrection, not his replacement.

Certainly an appropriate way to return power to a dead Lord of Murder.~

You and Sarevok shared the same blood, the same lineage, but you have not believed the lies. You have heard the whispers your sibling must have, but the rantings of shadows are not your concern. Obviously Sarevok was not as strong as you, and placed too much faith in a power long dead. He was willing to play the pawn, and as such he was doomed to fall before you.

His fool's gambit failed him, but there is still danger in Sarevok's passing. For you, and the rest of the Realms alike.

Indeed, they seem almost frightened whenever he approaches them and tries to catch their eye... As of yet, I cannot fathom the relevance of this to my investigation.

I'll pay 50 gp for every bandit scalp you can bring me—and spread the news. Some of the merchants in the region have also decided to pitch in and give money for the bandit scalps, but I'll give you the best price.

The sun's baked them firm and hard and the plow breaks at the very thought of trying to turn that tortured soil. My son tried pushing the new seeds in between the cracks but I doubt anything will come of it. Come this time next year, we'll all be living in the endless slums of Athkatla. So yes, I wish things were better in this here pristine and pastoral setting!~
@19483 = ~Aye, but there it is to dig your own grave. In the mines, the very claws of the baatezu will rake your skin and haul you down into the unknown depths. We are not well off here on the surface but we are better off, I can assure you. Pity the souls of those wretched miners.~

We are free to go where we wish and speak to whomever we please. Nobles must worry about being seen with the "wrong sort," or being caught in the "wrong place."

@19538 = ~What are you talking about, we've killed no one. I think you're a little addled in the head, perhaps you should calm down so that we can figure out who really killed your "brothers."~
@19539 = ~Well, we've been through the Cloakwood and fought our way through every level of a guarded and secret iron mine at its heart! There were mages at every turn, casting lightning bolts and fireballs into the heart of our party before stepping through their dimension doors to renew their attacks from another flank! Aye, there was loss and carnage but I revel in the memory of it still!~

@19541 = ~You'll pay for your crimes! The wrath of Malar will strike you down.~
@19542 = ~I must apologize for the actions of Osmadi. He had lost his mind after what happened here... some days past.

@19546 = ~Thank you for your valuable assistance. It is a shame that Osmadi had to be dealt with in such a manner, but there was little choice.~
@19547 = ~It's true, we knew each other very well. But there was nothing that could be done... he had lost his mind. I think you can understand that. Sometimes one doesn't have a choice.~
@19548 = ~We understand, you don't have to explain yourself. We must thank you again for your valuable assistance.~
@19549 = ~It's rather hard to believe that you would write off a life so readily. Come now, there must have been some other choice.~
@19550 = ~Perhaps we will meet again. I wish you luck on your journeys.~
@19551 = ~There was no other choice! Do I have to explain myself over and over. Please leave me be, so that I may bury my companion.~
@19552 = ~I am... sorry for being so rude. We will leave you in peace.~
@19553 = ~So... now he's your companion? That's very strange indeed. I don't know of too many people who would go about murdering their "companions."~
@19554 = ~Goodnight and goodbye to you, <CHARNAME>. It is late and we were leaving, weren't we my Merry Fools?~
@19555 = ~I murdered NO ONE! I did what had to be done! All of you might be dead if it weren't for my help! Leave me be.~
@19556 = ~Sorry... we just had to be sure.~
@19557 = ~I think you're lying! I think you wanted our help to kill him. You're just a common killer!~
@19558 = ~Yes... leave me be.~
@19559 = ~You... are correct. I did need your assistance to kill Osmadi. Thank you for the help. You were wrong about one thing. I am no "common killer"... I am a Shadow Druid. I poisoned Osmadi and his companions, so that we could be rid of their weakling presence. Now, we should easily be able to make this land our own. Unfortunately, there will be no room for meddling city folk. It is time for you to feel the fury of nature, as only I can administer it. Goodbye!~

@19734 = ~Oh, the sea harbors more tales than you have days left to live, young one. Why, I could go on all night with stories of Pirates that sail the Nelanther Isles, or strange merchants with goods that defy description. I wager I know what tale you would be keen on hearing though, the tale of old Balduran himself. A great man he was, and he sailed farther than most of us could dream. 'Twas his coin that built the great wall that protects our fair city, and none of us would be here save for his efforts.~
@19735 = ~As you will, but if you've not the patience to listen to the past, your future will be bleak indeed. At least take the time to admire the docks and ships at port. The workmanship is inspiring, even if ye know little of the ways of the sea.~
@19736 = ~He sounds like a great man. What happened to him?~
@19737 = ~It sounds as if he was no more than a smuggler whose story has been overinflated through time.~
@19738 = ~Sorry, but I don't have time for a tale as long as this.~
@19739 = ~As is often the case with great men, no one knows what became of him. He set out one day for the fabled isles of Anchorome and was not seen again. Some occasionally say that they see the rigging of his ship on the horizon, and the more romantic tales speak of him sailing the stars themselves. Many a cynic claims that he simply foundered on some deserted isle, but talk like that around here and you'll likely be fed your teeth. I've talked your ear off, I have. I'll let you be on your way.~
@19740 = ~Them's dangerous words around here. The only reason you don't get a slap from me is because I can see you are young and obviously foolish. Experienced at commerce he was, but Balduran was no common smuggler. His efforts paved the way for the founders of this city, and you would do well to display the proper respect. Leave me be, I don't feel like talking to you anymore.~
@19741 = ~Hail and well met, stranger. I take it you are an adventuring sort? I could tell the moment I saw you. You do not have the manicured hands of the fops we usually get through here. Might I have a moment or two of your time?~
@19742 = ~What do you want of me?~
@19743 = ~I'll listen... for the right price.~
@19744 = ~Go away, son; you bother me.~
@19745 = ~If you wish, though you are foolish to rebuke me before you know my offer. I could have made your group the heroes of an ode, but now you shall be the ogrish louts of a dirty limerick or two. Something about being a dirty little nipper of a cabin boy, I think.~
@19746 = ~Well I'll tell you. I am a bard, and a soon-to-be-great bard, I might add. All I really need is some good material for a song or two, and I'll be playing the big rooms. Seeing as how the masses always like tales of daring-do, I need to purchase a few details off of you. I could always make something up, but such things never ring true. Are you interested?~
@19747 = ~My, aren't you the moral champion of the day. I fail to see why I should be chastised because I don't wish to risk my neck chasing down vermin or bandits. Leave me be then.~

@19751 = ~No self-respecting bard would do such a thing, and I won't help you.~
@19752 = ~Oh that's fine, as I have more than enough money to spend. Basically I require a few stories from you, which I will alter slightly for dramatic effect and present as my own. I could just make something up, but such efforts never ring true. They must be believable if the masses are going to fall for them. So what do you say? Shall I pay you... oh... how about 200 gold a story?~
@19753 = ~No self-respecting bard would do such a thing, and I won't help you.~
@19754 = ~The lot of a bard is to travel and learn. Why don't you go out and find your own stories?~
@19755 = ~A reasonable request. What if I paid you 200 gold for each idea?~
@19756 = ~No self-respecting bard would do such a thing, and I won't help you.~
@19757 = ~The lot of a bard is to travel and learn. Why don't you go out and find your own stories?~
@19758 = ~Why? Because it's DANGEROUS out there. I became a bard for the easy work and prestige among certain female members of my social set, not because I wanted to chase vermin down dungeon holes. Do you wish to help or not?~
@19759 = ~No self-respecting bard would do such a thing, and I won't help you.~
@19760 = ~Surely. What type of tales do you require?~
@19761 = ~I don't know. Something dashing and dangerous that will make the ladies go "my hero."~
@19762 = ~I've a grand piece about the Iron Throne. It would seem that they are in the midst of a plot to weaken the entire region to increase their power base, and possibly to allow for invasion from Amn. They don't seem to be totally in control of the crisis at this point though, and this has allowed me to come close to destroying them once and for all.~
@19763 = ~That sounds like such a load of poppycock. The Iron Throne is a merchants' consortium, and not likely to promote such a bloodbath as war with Amn would bring. Killing all the customers is generally bad for business and makes no sense. If you're not going to be serious with me I'll take my leave.~
@19764 = ~I've faced all manner of beastie and bandit in my travels, and come near death more times than I can count. Would you like to hear of the feral viciousness of gibberlings, or perhaps of the cunning of the common kobold? I could tell of the strength of the gnoll, or the size of the ogre?~
@19765 = ~Well, that all just sounds rather brutish. I'm not sure what my muse is supposed to do with such tales. Perhaps, as they say, I just really had to be there. Take your money, and I shall slink away to write some songs about the high price of ale and how my silken sheets chafe. This bard business is going to be rather difficult if I am restricted to writing of things I know or understand.~
@19766 = ~I could relate how I have seen good people struck down unjustly, or the strength of character of the common farmer. Perhaps an ode to the conviction of the adventuring cleric, or how good people fight for what is right in the face of incredible odds. What say you?~
@19767 = ~Hmm... tales of conviction and strength of spirit. I have no clue where to start telling a tale about that. If I were an introspective sort I might conclude that I can't write about things I don't understand. As it is, I'm sure it's someone else's fault. I don't think you'll be much use to me after all.~
@19768 = ~How about a tale of gold, and the frenzied lust it inspires in people? The treachery of a friend that stabs you in the back for the coins you just pulled out of the depths of a dungeon, or the foolishness of a man who dropped all his arrows to make room for more treasure and faces his enemies defenseless for it?~
@19769 = ~Good, good. I can understand the motivations of these people and tales. I'm sure I could write a fine ballad about these things, as I know their subjects well and true. Unfortunately, songs about such things are not likely to increase my tips or inspire my listeners to applause. If I were more philosophical I might realize this as a flaw within myself, but as it is I am sure it is someone else's fault. Take your money and leave me, I don't think I can use you after all.~
@19770 = ~I am Ratchild! I destroy all those who oppose my people. Feel the wrath of Ratchild; feel my wrath and tremble!~
@19771 = ~Feel your wrath? By all the gods, you're just a kobold. I think you might have a small mix-up on who should be trembling. Draw steel men, and let's cut up these little dog men!~

@19798 = ~I see. Well, as it turns out, I have met you previously. Your manner has turned out far different than I would have guessed, however. I was acquainted with your foster father, as were many others, and visited him here a number of times while you grew up. His death has been mourned across the coast, and you would do well to represent his spirit in a better fashion. Treating people with respect would be a good start.~
@19799 = ~Ah, stow your manners and civility. I've changed much, and will represent my OWN spirit as I see fit.~
@19800 = ~A rather strange place to meet living members of the sunlit realms. I am curious as to why you are here. Could I rightly assume that you have something in common with the man Sarevok Anchev?~
@19801 = ~You have Gorion's stubborn will, if not his reason. I will leave you to your tasks. There are some within the central keep who wish to speak with you, so it would be wise of you to visit there sometime.~
@19802 = ~<CHARNAME>! Then I know you well, though you may be hard pressed to remember. I was last here years ago, and conferred with your foster father as you were off to chores. I am not much your senior, really. I am certain you tire of hearing it, and that legion have told you the same, but Gorion was well known to me. His death has been mourned by many.~
@19803 = ~We have nothing to do with Sarevok! He is a vile man, deserving only death.~
@19804 = ~We are cohorts of Sarevok.~
@19805 = ~It is none of your concern why we're here, or who we are!~
@19806 = ~Before we say anything more, would you be willing to tell us who you are?~
@19807 = ~You are wrong. It is very much our concern. Since you don't seem willing to tell us your identity, then we'll just have to determine it from the possessions on your corpse.~
@19808 = ~You serve Sarevok, and not the Iron Throne? This becomes more and more interesting, the more I discover. So... does your master think he can escape the wrath of the Iron Throne? Did he think he could kill three members of the high council and escape the Throne's vengeance?~
@19809 = ~I do not wish to dwell on his death. I have moved on with my life, though I cherish the memories.~
@19810 = ~His death is in the past and shall remain there. I am my own person and have my own concerns.~
@19811 = ~Our master can do what he wishes! There are none more powerful than Sarevok.~
@19812 = ~Who are you to question the actions of Sarevok?!~
@19813 = ~You have a strong hatred of him then? He doesn't seem to be that skilled at making friends. I am Rahvin, in the employ of the Iron Throne. My companions and I have traveled from Sembia to learn what has been happening to our operations in Baldur's Gate. It seems that Sarevok has been quite busy, murdering Rieltar and any other who got in his way. What he's done to you is anyone's guess... Wait! I recognize you now. You're <CHARNAME>! Ahhh... so you've come down here to end your crusade against the Iron Throne. Well, it'll be simple enough to dispatch you before we do Sarevok. My superiors will be quite happy to learn of your demise.~
@19814 = ~I have received sympathy from many a person I have never met before. Who was he to receive such adulation?~
@19815 = ~Simple respect is all that it is. Gorion did many good things for many people. When last I spoke with him I was barely acquainted with his fellows myself, but those who harp do tend to keep to themselves their affiliations. He was a longstanding member, from what I understand. Likely he said nothing to you because he wished your childhood to be as normal as possible. I suppose all parents wish this, whether the child is theirs or not. I have yet to meet anyone who made claim to achieving it though. How do you wager you have fared?~
@19816 = ~I must apologize for my outburst, but I have pressing concerns to attend to.~
@19817 = ~I am sorry. How were you acquainted with Gorion?~
@19818 = ~As you wish. I will bother you no more. There are some within the central keep who wish to speak with you, so it would be wise of you to visit there sometime.~
@19819 = ~Oh, he was a respected sage before I was old enough to lift the Tome of Universal Harmony, let alone understand a word. He knew a great deal about this world, and much of the next as well. I heard rumors of his escapades with those who harp as well, but he never spoke of such things to me. I get the feeling that he devoted most of his attentions to raising you, and gave up whatever ribald life he lived in his youth. He would not have had it any other way, though. You seem to have fared well enough for it.~
@19820 = ~None are more powerful than Sarevok? Well, you're not Sarevok, and you won't be staying too much longer in the land of the living.~
@19821 = ~I am Rahvin. My friends and I are mercenaries in the employ of the Iron Throne. We've been sent to hunt down Sarevok. Seems as if he went crazy and started murdering all who got in his way, including Rieltar, and the Throne don't take too well to having their high ups killed. You know... the longer I talk to you the more familiar you become. You're <CHARNAME>, aren't you! Well, well, well... it seems as if we've gotten lucky. Killing you will give us a nice hefty bonus. Sorry 'bout this, but you're not wanted dead or alive: only dead.~
@19822 = ~Perhaps that is for the best. I will speak no more of it, save to say that he was a good man. How have you fared in the time since?~
@19823 = ~As well as can be expected, though I have learned much about myself that perhaps was better left unknown.~
@19824 = ~As much as I would like to continue our chat, I have important matters to attend to. Forgive me, but I must go.~
@19825 = ~Would that I had a gold coin for every person I have heard say such a thing. I am sure your troubles vary greatly from my own experience, but we all have trials we must overcome. We all have a side that should not see the light of day too often. What matters is how much strength you wish to let it have. Bah, such words are better saved for classes and meditations, not for reunions. I will take my leave, though perhaps I shall see you again before I am to go. The tomes of Candlekeep are very nearly endless, and I am sure to be here for a tenday at least. There are some within the central keep who wish to speak with you, so it would be wise of you to visit there sometime. Fare well, my friend.~

@19957 = ~It is not for me to say, but I should keep an eye on your purse strings while here. Three are from the Iron Throne, supposedly the leaders themselves. The others are from Amn. I believe they are representing the Knights of the Shield. They both claim this trip is to discuss future trading relations, because the Iron Throne has grown so much as of late. I know very little of the economics of Baldur's Gate, but I would hazard a guess that both are more than mere businessmen.~
@19958 = ~You not smell right. You smell of fear... you not Blacktalon, you intruders!~
@19959 = ~Garclax~
@19960 = ~Garclax~
@19961 = ~You not allowed in here! Gnolls kept in cave until tempers calm. If you go in there... don't expect to come out in one piece!~
@19962 = ~What do you mean by that? I have had "dealings" with the Iron Throne, so I would like to know what they are up to.~
@19963 = ~Well, thanks for the warning. I shall be wary.~
@19964 = ~Not much at all, but rumors are never in short supply. I hear that these meetings are more like negotiations, because the Iron Throne threatens to move into Knights of the Shield territory. I overheard one of them, accidentally of course, and I think the Iron Throne has gained a lot of power from the iron shortage. Appropriate, don't you think? They are meeting here because they consider it neutral ground and relatively safe. I doubt Keeper of the Tomes Ulraunt would have allowed their entry had he know who they are, though they have done nothing wrong here.~
@19965 = ~Not a problem. We must get together sometime while you are here.~
@19966 = ~Oh, I hope you haven't thrown your lot in with them. I hear they are such unsavory types. More into power than commerce. I overheard them talking, and they have actually profited from the iron crisis! That's why the Knights of the Shield are here; the Iron Throne has gained a lot of influence lately and threatens to take over certain Amnian interests. I am surprised Keeper of the Tomes Ulraunt allowed them entry, but they have done nothing wrong that can be proved.~
@19967 = ~Thank you for the information. I should be going.~
@19968 = ~Hmm. I don't suppose you know which rooms they are staying in?~
@19969 = ~I have said too much already. I certainly don't want to seem like a gossip. I should go. Please; we should speak some other time before you go.~
@19970 = ~Thanks for the information. I'll just be off to my room now.~
@19971 = ~I don't suppose you know which rooms they will be using?~
@19972 = ~<CHARNAME>! Good to see you! I trust you are well?~
@19973 = ~As well as can be expected, Piato. How have you been?~
@19974 = ~I feel as though life is dragging me along by a noose, Piato. Not good at all.~
@19975 = ~My friend, I am so sorry to hear this! Please, if you need to chat about anything, do not hesitate to come by my quarters. You do remember where they are, don't you? No matter. First we must make sure you get some rest. Gorion's old room is where you shall stay. No need to tell you where it is, I am sure. Third room on the south corridor, just as it was. I believe there may be a few things there that Gorion left to you. Here, let me take you to the chest.~
@19976 = ~Get out of my way, Piato. I am not in the mood to speak with you.~
@19977 = ~Well, as irritable as ever. I do wish you had inherited Gorion's courtesy, instead of the trinkets we left for you in his room. You do remember the way, don't you? Or have you blocked your humble beginnings from your important little mind? Third room on the south corridor. Get some rest, and perhaps you will be more agreeable.~
@19978 = ~Oh, I pine for the days when you and Gorion still called Candlekeep home. You brought a bit of energy to these walls. I shall have to speak with you later at length, but for now you must rest. Gorion's old room is the third on the south corridor, just as it was. I think there are a few things for you there as well. We shall see you later.~
@19979 = ~Well dip me in broth and call me stewed, if it isn't little <CHARNAME>! Why, I haven't seen you for nearly... umm... quite some time, anyway.~
@19980 = ~You little rounder! Such a temper on you! Show some respect to the man who helped change your diapers! Hrmph! And you were such a nice child, once upon a time. Go on, get lost, you brat.~
@19981 = ~Hello, Theodon; how have you been?~
@19982 = ~Get out of my way, old man. I have no time to speak with you.~
@19983 = ~I still remember you running about the keep in your little swaddling clothes, pestering the elders and spooking the cows. Ain't that right, Jessup?~
@19984 = ~Surely was.~
@19985 = ~Yep. Of course, you never did stay in those rags of yours long.~
@19986 = ~I don't have the time for this, you old geezer. Goodbye!~
@19987 = ~Yes, yes, I remember. But how have you been?~
@19988 = ~You'd be naked as a jaybird the moment someone turned their back on you. I remember the day that fella Blackstaff come floating in and there you were, tearing around the outer keep with Gorion hot on your trail. Took the cloak right off his back, you did, and made yourself just the cutest little...~
@19989 = ~I don't need this kind of aggravation, you geezer! Get lost!~
@19990 = ~Yes yes YES, I remember. Could we drop it please? How have YOU been?~
@19991 = ~Wait wait, I remember it all now! There was Khelben Blackstaff, trying his hardest to look important while you ran through the stables with his cape tied around your waist. Such a lark, eh Jessup?~
@19992 = ~I thought I'd catch my death from laughing, I did.~
@19993 = ~You and me both! Gorion was shaking like a leaf, he was so mad.~
@19994 = ~I've about had enough out of you two! Get lost!~
@19995 = ~As fun as this has been, I should really be going.~
@19996 = ~Nobody was sure what to do, and then Khelben mutters some words and catches you by the scruff of the neck with some sort of spectral hand. He hauls you out and drops you right in front of him, grabbing his filthy cape in the process. Everyone was scared, they were. Weren't they, Jessup?~
@19997 = ~Sure enough. Scared witless.~
@19998 = ~Yep, and then old Khelben busts out in the biggest laugh you ever heard. Everyone in the keep was laughing like mad, except you, <CHARNAME>. You just stood there naked as the day your were born and wondering what the fuss was about. I tell you, those were the days.~
@19999 = ~Um, yes. I think I'll be going now.~
@20000 = ~Keep your hazy recollections to yourselves, you old farts!~
@20001 = ~Oh certainly, little one. Stop by any old time though. I've got some paintings of you as a youngster I'm sure your little friends would love to see. Remember the one of <CHARNAME> on the bearskin rug, Jessup?~
@20002 = ~Surely do. In the buff as usual.~
@20003 = ~Cute as a bug, you were. Go play with your friends now. Go on.~
@20004 = ~Oh, hello young one. I trust you are keeping out of trouble? Of course you are. Run along and play with your little friends now.~
@20005 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>, it is good to see you here once again. A pity you could not have returned during a more restful time.~
@20006 = ~Why? What is going on that would cause you such stress?~
@20007 = ~You always were a worrier. I'm sure all is well.~
@20008 = ~What business is it of yours?~
@20009 = ~Oh, it's nothing I am sure. It's just that, well, things just seem a little strange around here. Those decidedly un-merchant-like merchants for one. And some of our own monks are acting odd as well. One fellow in particular.~
@20010 = ~I'm sure it is nothing. You should not worry yourself so much.~
@20011 = ~Really? And who would that be?~
@20012 = ~Perhaps I shouldn't, but that Koveras is such an odd fellow, and I have not seen him around before now. I should think I would be aware of any new brethren joining us, but he just appeared the other day. Perhaps he is a visiting sage, but he seems very disinterested in our tomes, and more interested in our visitors. Bah, I am being silly. It is not for me to decide how someone should spend his or her day. I shall continue my studies. Good day to you.~
@20013 = ~Well, there is this fellow named Koveras. I assume he is a visiting sage of some sort, but he seems more interested in our guests than the tomes. He makes me nervous. I think he's had the same effect on others as well. Young Shistal has been out of sorts for days now. He is not as thick-skinned as I. You remember how nervous he used to be? He's quite the opposite now. Seems like a totally different person. I worry about him. I should go. It has been nice speaking with you.~
@20014 = ~Perhaps you are right, though that Koveras fellow still makes me nervous. I think he has had the same effect on others as well. Shistal has been quite unlike his normal self. I should go. Please enjoy your stay.~
@20015 = ~I suppose it is none of my business. I merely wished to welcome you back. I see you are as tactless as ever. Such a pity that so many are so rude these days. That Koveras fellow is like that as well. Shistal has even become rude. Perhaps I am just too sensitive. Off with you. I wish to continue my studies.~
@20016 = ~Leave me be, stranger. I've... work to do.~
@20017 = ~All the other monks gave me a warm welcome. Why not you?~
@20018 = ~Do you not recognize me? It is <CHARNAME>.~
@20019 = ~Sorry to have disturbed you. I will go.~
@20020 = ~Good riddance.~
@20021 = ~I've no interest in idle chatter. If you knew the daily routine of a monk you would understand.~
@20022 = ~Um, certainly. <CHARNAME>. I did not recognize your face. My apologies. I trust your journeys have been comfortable? The Cloakwood can be cold this time of year. If you will excuse me, I should go.~
@20023 = ~Of course. I will not disturb you further.~
@20024 = ~How did you know I had gone to the Cloakwood?~
@20025 = ~Eh, I have relatives in the region. Yes, they must have seen you and sent a note on your progress.~
@20026 = ~How would they know who I was? I think you're lying.~
@20027 = ~I know the routine well. I lived here for many years. It is YOU who should know ME.~
@20028 = ~My apologies. I will not disturb you further.~
@20029 = ~But Shistal, you never mentioned any family before.~
@20030 = ~That must be it. Sorry to have disturbed you.~
@20031 = ~Of course. It is just that I did not recognize your face. I am just not acquainted with all of the monks quite yet.~
@20032 = ~I was not a monk. I think you are lying.~
@20033 = ~Sorry then. I hope I haven't distressed you. Goodbye.~
@20034 = ~We are estranged and do not see each other often. There was no need to mention it. I really should be going now. There are things I must do.~
@20035 = ~I think you are lying to me, Shistal. You are not the same man I knew.~
@20036 = ~Sorry to have disturbed you.~
@20037 = ~You would do well to leave me be. I tire of this game. Take your questions and go away, monkey.~
@20038 = ~Oh no, I have many more questions to ask. For starters, who are you really?~
@20039 = ~I did not mean to alarm you. Perhaps I was mistaken. Goodbye.~
@20040 = ~I am your deathhhh, foolish meat!~
@20041 = ~<CHARNAME>! Stay where you are! I do not wish to harm you, but you must come with me! You are to be questioned regarding the murder of the Iron Throne leaders. They were apparently killed not an hour ago, and an item of yours was found with the bodies. Please, you will get a fair trial if you come quietly. I will use force if I must.~
@20042 = ~Do not do this! You must believe me, I am innocent!~
@20043 = ~That is not for me to decide. Please, you have my word that you will not be harmed. If you are innocent you will be judged accordingly.~
@20044 = ~All right, I surrender. Take me to Ulraunt or Tethtoril so I can prove my innocence.~
@20045 = ~I will not be judged at all! Draw your weapons!~
@20046 = ~I will come quietly. Your weapons will not be necessary.~
@20047 = ~I am glad to hear that. I did not wish to harm you. I am sure this mess will be cleared up soon.~
@20048 = ~Do not force me to harm you! I will give you one more chance to come quietly! If not, you will be killed! You have little choice in this matter, other than to live or to die.~
@20049 = ~You cannot enter the store; there are monsters nearby.~
@20050 = ~If that is how it must be then I will come quietly, I have no wish to inflict harm upon any friends.~
@20051 = ~So be it then. You must be guilty if you fear judgement so much. You life ends here. I... I am sorry.~
@20052 = ~Who...?! Get out of my way! I don't care who you are, I just want out of here.~
@20053 = ~None shall escape! I will kill you all!~
@20054 = ~And just who are you?~
@20055 = ~Oh, that is just great! As if Sarevok wasn't bad enough! He marches in, announces our leaders have been killed, and promptly assumes command. Now I have to deal with you as well? Fine! Do your worst!~
@20056 = ~Pang is the name, and I'll thank you kindly to get out of my way! I don't care why you're hear. Take all you wish if you are thieves. I just want to leave. That Sarevok has become too big for his britches. Our leaders weren't a day dead before he declared the Iron Throne to be his.~
@20057 = ~Then you won't mind if I help myself to your coffers, will you?~
@20058 = ~It does not matter. I will destroy all of you regardless.~
@20059 = ~~
@20060 = ~It's time, then, is it?~
@20061 = ~Not yet.~
@20062 = ~That it is.~
@20063 = ~Time for what? Explain yourself.~
@20064 = ~Why does Tazok draw it out, so? If he is to kill me, he should kill me, not let me waste away as a prisoner in his tent!~
@20065 = ~A prisoner? You're not a bandit like the rest?~
@20066 = ~You know too much, that's why.~
@20067 = ~I be a thief and from the city, but no, I'm no bandit. I know too much to run with Tazok and his crew.~
@20068 = ~What do you know?~
@20069 = ~Judging by the delicate position you find yourself in at present, you obviously didn't know enough not to be caught by them.~
@20070 = ~This whole thing is dirty to the core, that's what I know! These aren't your ordinary bandits, here. These are part the Blacktalons and part Chill, Chill being a demihuman band, mostly hobgoblins, and led by that creepy smart one, Ardenor Crush. There be others elsewhere, like that priest Mulahey sent to poison the mines of Nashkel. Set himself up as a kobold god returned and legions of the brainless barking fools believed him, ready to do his bidding 'til death do they part...~
@20071 = ~Mulahey's dead. He was working for Tazok, I understand. Question is, who's Tazok working for?~
@20072 = ~That's the trick, see? Crush and Taugosz Khosann, leader of the Blacktalons, both think he's getting orders from the Zhents and Tazok doesn't do much to discourage that particular line of thinking. But the Blacktalons and Chill are bandit groups, see? They ply the trade routes, avoid the cities, and that's where they go wrong. I'm from the Gate and I can tell you dead as leather that the Zhentarim aren't behind this.~
@20073 = ~How can you be so sure?~
@20074 = ~A desire for silence isn't the only reason I wear soft-soled boots. I wear 'em so I can tell who's toes I'm treading on. I didn't mess with no Zhentarim. I picked my enemies and I messed with one group and one group only—the Iron Throne. And, right as rain, here I am as Tazok's personal prisoner. You do the math.~
@20075 = ~Bah, they are nearly empty regardless! Sarevok has been making decisions on the sidelines for some time now, and it has cost us all plenty. He does not seem concerned with profits or much of anything! The iron shortage became his pet project, but he has used it to inflame tensions instead of build business! He's brought us down as sure as if he was some "hero." What reason he would have to provoke a war, I don't know. Enjoy your looting, I'm leaving for good.~
@20076 = ~The Iron Throne. Where can I find them?~
@20077 = ~~
@20078 = ~Tazok's been making regular visits to the Cloakwood so that's where I'd start if I were you. There are some documents in that chest that might be worth taking a look at, too... Now go step on some toes, alright? And you can tell them Ender Sai sent you.~
@20079 = ~Don't mark me a fool. I may be Tazok's prisoner but he's not the one that caught me.~
@20080 = ~What do you mean?~
@20081 = ~This whole thing is dirty to the core, that's what I mean! These aren't your ordinary bandits, here. These are part the Blacktalons and part Chill, Chill being a demihuman band, mostly hobgoblins, and led by that creepy smart one, Ardenor Crush. There be others elsewhere, like that priest Mulahey sent to poison the mines of Nashkel. Set himself up as a kobold god returned and legions of the brainless barking fools believed him, ready to do his bidding 'til death do they part...~
@20082 = ~Mulahey's dead. He was working for Tazok, I understand. Question is, who's Tazok working for?~
@20083 = ~I know too much, do I? Like what?~
@20084 = ~That's none of your business.~
@20085 = ~The job has already been done! Who needs YOU when we have Sarevok?! If not for that fool they have accused, I would have guessed Sarevok killed our leaders. He has frittered away our gold, used our grandest plots to inflame governments, and done nothing but laugh when accused of ruining our organization! He seems quite sane, so I can only assume he has some motive of his own. It is not to the benefit of the Iron Throne, that much is certain. Do what you will. I am leaving before anything else goes wrong.~
@20086 = ~You know that Tazok ordered Mulahey to poison the ore in Nashkel, for instance, and much more besides.~
@20087 = ~Look, you can give up your silly facade, now. We're on the same side and it ain't Tazok's. I can see it in your eyes... You were right about one thing, though: I know a heck of a lot about what's going on around here, so listen close.~
@20088 = ~Alright, alright. What do you know?~
@20089 = ~Yeah, I know about Mulahey... and I spit in his face and Tazok's, too. And you know what else I know? Tazok's no Zhent man. He's got all you poor foolish bandits convinced, doesn't he... Well mark my words, you've all gone soft if you think that's the truth of it. He covers his arse nicely and lets you and the Zhents take the rap for it.~
@20090 = ~Who's he working for, then, hot-shot?~
@20091 = ~Alright, the game's up. We're not bandits and we're no friends of Tazok and Mulahey, either. The latter's dead by our hands at the bottom of the mines as we speak.~
@20092 = ~A merchant group, the Iron Throne. They want a monopoly on the iron trade and they're using fools like you to drive up the price and make their fortune. If they can push us into a war with Amn, all the better, because nothing increases demand for iron like a good war, don't you see?~
@20093 = ~Where can I find this Iron Throne?~
@20094 = ~Tazok's been going into the Cloakwood to get his orders. He keeps all his documents in the chest over there. Go look for yourself and make it quick. Ol' Tazok won't be pleased to find a lowly prisoner spreading mutiny among his men.~
@20095 = ~Who are you? Have you business here? Ah, what does it matter? everything is in shambles.~
@20096 = ~So Mulahey's dead, is he? That's good to hear but, all the same, he's just small-time. Even Tazok's not the head honcho in this whole mess. Ardenor Crush and Taugosz Khosann both think he's getting orders from the Zhents and Tazok doesn't do much to discourage that particular line of thinking. But Crush and Khosann are bandits, see? They ply the trade routes, avoid the cities, and that's where they go wrong. I'm from the Gate and I can tell you dead as leather that the Zhentarim aren't behind this.~
@20097 = ~I am here to put an end to the Iron Throne!~
@20098 = ~How can you be so sure?~
@20099 = ~As much as your eagerness should impress me, it does not. You are a bit late, by my standards. The leadership... of the western division of the Iron Throne... my father and friends... all three are dead. Killed in Candlekeep and I should have seen it coming!~
@20100 = ~Then kill me here and get it over with. Tazok's been dragging this out far too long.~
@20101 = ~Dragging what out?~
@20102 = ~Kill you? Not likely.~
@20103 = ~My execution, what do you think? ...You're not with him, are you, though. No, I'd smell his rancid breath on you if you were.~
@20104 = ~I expected more resistance to my breaking in. What is going on here?~
@20105 = ~There is very little going on here. Everything is falling apart as we speak... and one person is to blame...~
@20106 = ~You're right, we're not Tazok's lackeys. What's going on here?~
@20107 = ~~
@20108 = ~Aye, you're not... Well, this whole place is dirty to the core, that's what's going on. These aren't your ordinary bandits. They're part the Blacktalons and part Chill, Chill being a demihuman band, mostly hobgoblins, and led by that creepy smart one, Ardenor Crush. There be others elsewhere, like that priest Mulahey sent to poison the mines of Nashkel. Set himself up as a kobold god returned and legions of the brainless barking fools believed him, ready to do his bidding 'til death do they part...~
@20109 = ~Aye! And I shall plague you to the very end!~
@20110 = ~And just who might that be?~
@20111 = ~What? Who are you? I speak of Sarevok, the new self-proclaimed "leader" of the Iron Throne. My father Bruno was barely a day dead when Sarevok made his claim, and now everything is crumbling. I am sure he orchestrated the whole thing so he could gain control, but if he wanted to run the organization, why does he act as though he does not care for it? I have no idea, but I will put a blade in his belly before the day is through, regardless. Who did you claim to be?~
@20112 = ~Mulahey's dead. He was working for Tazok, I understand. Question is, who's Tazok working for?~
@20113 = ~Things grow darker here, darker than I thought possible. In Tazok's tent, I came across a prisoner, Ender Sai. If he speaks true, and I suspect the documents he referred to in Tazok's chest will show he does, the bandits are being played as pawns by a power group called, tellingly enough, the Iron Throne. Tazok's orders are coming from some base of theirs within the Cloakwood and I have little doubt that it is there that I must journey next if I wish to peel back the next layer of this mystery. Something still seems very wrong in this. It haunts me, dancing endlessly along the periphery of my thoughts. What it is, however, I know not.~
@20114 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I stand accused of the murder of the Iron Throne leaders.~
@20115 = ~Things grow darker here, darker than I thought possible. In Tazok's tent, I came across a prisoner, Ender Sai. If he speaks true, and I suspect the documents he referred to in Tazok's chest will show he does, the bandits are being played as pawns by a power group called, tellingly enough, the Iron Throne. They meddle in the affairs of nations as if they were gods, pushing Amn and Baldur's Gate to the brink of war in order to line their pockets. They apparently maintain a base within the Cloakwood and I have little doubt that it is there that I must journey next if I wish to peel back the next layer of this mystery. Something still seems very wrong in this, however. It haunts me, dancing endlessly in the shadows, never coming into the light. What it is, however, I know not.~
@20116 = ~Ender Sai~
@20117 = ~Ender Sai~
@20118 = ~I don't like the looks of ye, I don't.~
@20119 = ~Nor do I like the looks of ye but it's better than a face of pulpy mush, now don't you think?~
@20120 = ~What you like or do not like is hardly my concern. I'd just like to know a bit about this place.~
@20121 = ~Are you threatening me?~
@20122 = ~Are you kidding? With a face like yours, it's a compliment!~
@20123 = ~Keep your voice down or my next move won't be a threat. I want to know how this whole place is laid out and I want to know it now.~
@20124 = ~I am here seeking Sarevok!~
@20125 = ~Sarevok is the foul spawn that surely did the deed! He craves the power of the Iron Throne, but for what purpose I do not know! He throws away gold like it was copper, and uses our best laid plans to inflame governments instead of bargaining for wealth! He's in line to become a Grand Duke because of his efforts to fight his OWN chaos, but I doubt his coronation will stop his lust for carnage. Who are YOU, by the way? What are you doing here?~
@20126 = ~Get out of here... I said I don't like ye and it's not liable to change anytime soon.~
@20127 = ~-gulp-... Heh, it's a bandit camp—tents here, tents there, ain't got no damn geography to it.~
@20128 = ~Get out of here, you disgust me.~
@20129 = ~Then make some. Which one is Tazok's tent?~
@20130 = ~The— the big one in the... in the northeast part of the camp.~
@20131 = ~Alright, I've got what I want out of you. Don't suppose I can let you live, though, can I? Living lips tell tales, they say.~
@20132 = ~What's in there? Any guards or traps?~
@20133 = ~Loyalty in this camp runs about as strong as the iron they're stealing. With a little "encouragement," I was able to get one of the bandits to disclose that Tazok's tent lies in the northeast part of the encampment. If I'm to learn anything in this infernal place, I can only hope it will be there.~
@20134 = ~J-just the prisoner and his guards; no traps, honest!~
@20135 = ~Loyalty in this camp runs about as strong as the iron they're stealing. With a little "encouragement," I was able to get one of the bandits to disclose that Tazok's tent lies in the northeast part of the encampment. That guards lie within is no surprise but the fact that there be a prisoner too, aye, that may yet be of use. But I should not tarry here, pen in hand, lest my tunic become stained not with ink but with my own heart's blood.~
@20136 = ~I know they are dead, because I am accused of their murders!~
@20137 = ~Knott~
@20138 = ~Knott~
@20139 = ~Who do you think killed them?~
@20140 = ~I don't care who you are; no one's to enter Tazok's tent, under penalty of death.~
@20141 = ~Some fool is accused of their murders, but likely he was just some stooge. I know who is truly behind it, I am sure! Sarevok had to have been the cause! He came back here when they were not a day dead, and claimed the leadership for his own! I do not understand him though. He wrests control of everything for himself, but his actions are those of one who cares little for mercantile power. The iron crisis became his pet project, but he has used it to inflame and cause unrest, not to get wealth or power. He seems to want to propel the region into war. Whatever his motive, I'll not let him get away with it. Who ARE you, by the way?~
@20142 = ~Then come at me, for I've no intention of turning back.~
@20143 = ~We're here under Tazok's own instructions. He requested that we retrieve his files and documents and deliver them to him as soon as possible.~
@20144 = ~I am here to find Sarevok and put an end to him!~
@20145 = ~I am accused of murdering the Iron Throne leaders, and seek Sarevok so I might clear my name.~
@20146 = ~Your petty lies are wasted on me, <CHARNAME>. Like Ender Sai, here, you've crossed the Iron Throne for the last time.~
@20147 = ~Is that who you are? Then I owe you a knife in the gullet for what you have done! What, did Sarevok trick you into killing them, or did he just do it himself and then blame you? I'll kill you just to be safe, I will! For my father, someone will die tonight!~
@20148 = ~Raemon~
@20149 = ~Raemon~
@20150 = ~Uh, hullo. I'm Tersus. Are you da... Are you da new recruits?~
@20151 = ~I am here to kill Sarevok for what he has done!~
@20152 = ~I am here to clear my name of the murders of the Iron Throne leaders.~
@20153 = ~Uh, yeah, that's us.~
@20154 = ~Then I shall let you pass. The more blades that chase Sarevok this night, the better. I must go now.~
@20155 = ~Tersus? Nice name. If you turn it around backwards, it's Susret, you know.~
@20156 = ~You there! Stand your ground a moment! I demand to know what is going on here! I have been sent from Sembia to determine why this branch of the Iron Throne has foundered, and I have found no one who will stand still more than a second! What in blazes is going on here?~
@20157 = ~Good. I'm s'posed to give each of you some leather armor.~
@20158 = ~We already have all the armor we need, thanks.~
@20159 = ~Uh, sure, pile it on... Say, can you tell me a little about this place? Like who pays the wages around here?~
@20160 = ~Don't blame me, eh? It's just a job, okay. The boss sez give everyone leather armor and dat's what I do. Blacktalon, Chill, it's all da same, right?~
@20161 = ~Blacktalon? Chill? Who are they?~
@20162 = ~Blacktalon. Chill. All da same, yup.~
@20163 = ~Yup, all da same. All get leather armor cuz that's what the boss sez. Now dat you got it you can leave now, okay?~
@20164 = ~You're not wit' Blacktalon or Chill? You must be independents, then. Blacktalon, Chill, all da same, right? But independents, nobuddy sed nothin' 'bout independents. Better give me all that leather armor back. Blacktalon an' Chill, we be two groups of bandits. Me Chill. Blacktalon don't take no hobgoblins.~
@20165 = ~What's going on? The Iron Throne is in big trouble, and I'm the cause!~
@20166 = ~Why not ask Sarevok? He seems to be the one in control now.~
@20167 = ~Sarevok? That upstart? Then the rumors I have heard are true. Our regional leaders here are dead and Sarevok has assumed their roles. Such arrogance! No doubt he had a hand in their demise, I'll wager! That would explain why we have not been getting reports on progress here on the coast, but what could he be up to? I shall have to report these findings to my superiors at once. What is your name and rank here? I shall report of you as well.~
@20168 = ~Why would two groups of bandits be working together like this?~
@20169 = ~Because da boss sez, okay? Like don't blame me, already. Geeez, you independents are a lot a trubble.~
@20170 = ~I've learned something interesting from a hobgoblin stockboy, though I'm not sure what it all might mean. The bandit camp is apparently composed of two separate groups: the predominantly hobgoblin Chill and Blacktalon, the human faction. What could bring such different groups together, I don't yet know. Money is the obvious motivation, but how much and who's paying it? Whoever it is, they're obviously not short on coin.~
@20171 = ~Lieutenant <CHARNAME>, in charge of security.~
@20172 = ~Um, actually I am the person accused of killing the Iron Throne leaders.~
@20173 = ~Some say da Zhents, some say it might be da Iron Throne. I don't ask questions, eh. Da boss gives me money an' I hand out leather armor, it's dat simple. Chill, Blacktalon, I don't care who you are, I give you leather armor.~
@20174 = ~Blacktalon? Chill? Who are they?~
@20175 = ~Blacktalon. Chill. All da same, yup.~
@20176 = ~Stop dat, you're makin' my brain bleed so much my hair hurts. Susret, what do I need wit' a name like dat? Now, here, take dis leather armor like you're s'posed to an' move along, okay?~
@20177 = ~We already have all the armor we need, thanks.~
@20178 = ~Uh, sure, pile it on... Say, can you tell me a little about this place? Like who pays the wages around here?~
@20179 = ~I've learned something interesting from a hobgoblin stockboy in the bandit camp, today. He wasn't quite sure who was funding this whole operation but his guesses leaned towards either the Zhentarim or a new group, the Iron Throne. I don't know much about the latter, so I had best keep my eyes peeled and my ear to the ground. If I ever need leather armor, though, I know a hobgoblin stockboy who'd only be too eager to serve.~
@20180 = ~Nope, you been taken care of already. Next!~
@20181 = ~Tersus~
@20182 = ~Tersus~
@20183 = ~You are behind all of this chaos? Unlikely! Most rumors I hear point to one of our own, Sarevok, to be the cause of this turmoil. Unless... unless you are the one responsible for the trouble in the Cloakwood mines! The last report we received was about the destruction you caused! You have made some powerful enemies indeed, but I have neither the time nor inclination to face you here today. It would seem some major reconstruction is in order for this branch. Major reconstruction indeed.~
@20184 = ~Are you now? From what I have heard, Sarevok may have had a far more active role in that killing than any outsider. So what have you come here to do? Destroy us all to restore your name? It would seem that we now have a mutual enemy of sorts. I think my superiors would not be ungrateful if you were to remove Sarevok from this organization. I would almost call this outpost of the Iron Throne a complete loss, though with Sarevok gone, perhaps it could be built anew.~
@20185 = ~Perhaps it could, though I doubt people will trust you.~
@20186 = ~Are you sure you want to quit? Boo will miss you...~
@20187 = ~Out! Away! Fly while you can! There be madness here and I can stand it no longer!~
@20188 = ~Madness in this much-lauded tower? That there be malice here, I have no doubt... but madness? Never.~
@20189 = ~Calm down and explain yourself, good sir, that I might understand you better.~
@20190 = ~Then clearly you know it not! Madness seethes here and amongst Sarevok's crazed acolytes it overflows. I'm a simple merchant after a pretty coin but I swear it isn't worth it to suffer this place so long.~
@20191 = ~After a pretty coin, are you? Well, here's a chance to earn some off a saner soul. I'll pay 150 pieces of pretty coin if you tell me everything you know about this place.~
@20192 = ~After a pretty coin, are you? Would 300 gp be enough to make you stay awhile and tell me what you know of this place?~
@20193 = ~Sarevok's acolytes? Who do you speak of and where might I find them?~
@20194 = ~Yer dead, little worms!~
@20195 = ~A saner soul? I doubt that very much because while I go this way, you go that! Keep your maddened money, too, but beware of the acolytes. You will know them when you see them, I have no doubt. Now release your grip on my arm as I can bear this place no longer.~
@20196 = ~Not if I have a say in the matter!~
@20197 = ~People trust whom they wish to trust, whether there is reason or not. I would imagine that is why Sarevok has flourished. Plays on people's fears masterfully. If he were not so destructive he would have been a great asset. What IS he up to? No matter. I will report of all of this and we will wash our hands of the whole problem. Good day, and goodbye.~
@20198 = ~You do not. It will be done as sure as the sun will rise tomorrow. Our damage control officers are quite effective. A setback, yes, but we will eventually recover. Perhaps not here, but elsewhere. Good day and goodbye.~
@20199 = ~Aye, I guess, but I'll not be long about it. The acolytes I mentioned, they stay with Thaldorn on the fifth floor. Six of them, there are, and their madness comes in pairs: two priests, two mages, two hardened thugs. But there is something wrong about them—if they were here for the simple joys of a pretty coin, I'd have no quarrel with them. But no—they would not deign to be so human. There is something more, some secret agenda and I know not what... Ack, even now I can feel their pestilential eyes upon me. Your lucre can keep me here no longer, I'm afraid.~

@20207 = ~You will not escape! The Iron Throne will topple before me!~
@20208 = ~You'll know them when you see them and, should you continue on your maddened course, I have no doubt that see them you will! Now I beg your leave for I would rather gnaw through my own wrist than tarry here a moment longer. Fare thee well.~
@20209 = ~Why are you so panicked? Is not Sarevok in control?~
@20210 = ~Not to underestimate you or anything, but have you not noticed that you are a little bit late?! The Iron Throne is in a shambles, and I simply don't want to stand around and watch it crumble about my ears! That Sarevok and his enormous ambitions have left us in the lurch, and there is nothing for me to do now but cover my losses and run. He has used us all to get where he wished, and now is on the verge of becoming a Grand Duke! He would have made a fabulous ally, if he had not cared so little for anyone but himself.~
@20211 = ~Calm down? Calm down while Sarevok's acolytes practice their magic cacophony above me? I dare say not, stranger! I dare say not at all!~
@20212 = ~Sarevok becoming a Grand Duke? How can this be?~
@20213 = ~Quite simple, really. He has built up support by pledging to combat the very chaos he himself was sowing! I imagine he'll have a fantastic success rate too, seeing as how he is in total control with our leaders dead! I doubt that he will settle into a nice quiet political life though. He seems set on causing as much destruction as possible, and I think he is intent on pushing for war with Amn!~
@20214 = ~The Iron Throne tower is apparently no place for the faint of heart. A very distraught merchant by the name of Triadore nearly bowled me over on his reckless charge for the exit. Luckily I was uninjured and the impact slowed him enough that I could lure him into a frantic (and expensive) conversation. According to his hurried testimony, the tower's fifth floor is home to a small fanatical sect of some sort, acolytes of someone named Sarevok. It is becoming more and more apparent that there is more behind the Iron Throne than simple greed. Some secret agenda is afoot and, for the life of me, I must discover it.~

@20217 = ~Triadore~
@20218 = ~Why would he pursue such a destructive plan? What could he gain from it?~
@20219 = ~How should I know? I am no diviner. I only know business, and what he is doing makes very little economic sense. Had he wished to grow rich from dealing in ore, then I would have understood. Had he kept the Iron Throne intact he could have used his upcoming position as Duke to sanction Amn and increase our trading power over groups like the Knights of the Shield. As it is, he is seemingly intent on abandoning us and launching a bloodbath of a war. Know this: The people believe in Sarevok, and it will take more than a blade to reduce his stature in the eyes of the public.~
@20220 = ~Where do you think you're going?~
@20221 = ~Upstairs. Where do you think you're going?~
@20222 = ~The fifth floor. Sarevok asked us to deliver an important message to his acolytes.~
@20223 = ~Somewhere far away from wisecrackers like yerself, I hope. Guards, up the stairs! We have intruders!~
@20224 = ~I will not debate that he is in control, but whatever his plans, they certainly do not have the good of the Iron Throne in mind. He has abandoned us in favor of his new position, that of soon to be appointed Grand Duke. We are simply to be cast off, and I would not be surprised if he marches the Flaming Fist through here tomorrow as a show of his stance on mercantile crime!~
@20225 = ~Sarevok is to be a Grand Duke? How can this be?~
@20226 = ~I do not care about your troubles! I will destroy him, just as I destroyed your base in the Cloakwood!~
@20227 = ~Hmph. Better you than me. Working with that crowd can be downright creepy, some days.~
@20228 = ~A thorn in the side you may be, but I'll wager that Sarevok was likely done with that installation. Its destruction probably saved him the trouble of doing it himself, though marching the Flaming Fist through the mines would have only increased his popularity. With Entar Silvershield dead and Scar replaced with a lackey captain of the guard, Sarevok has no more use for us. He's moving on to bigger things, though what they are I have no idea. I have wasted enough time on you. Kill me if you must, but I have no intention of waiting around.~

@20238 = ~I will stop him regardless, just as I destroyed your plans in the Cloakwood!~
@20239 = ~I care not! I will destroy him and restore my name!~
@20240 = ~How can people believe in him? Can they not see his nature?~
@20241 = ~Then likely you will face the Flaming Fist and many other good people that follow him. He has fed their fears and now offers himself as their savior. With Entar Silvershield dead and the new captain of the guard in his pocket, no one is going to believe a fool such as you without proof. I've wasted enough time on you. If you must strike me down, then do so. Don't expect me to wait around while you do though.~
@20242 = ~I seen people go up there with— with one face and... and come back down with another. I don't know how else to say it— I got a keen eye for faces, I do, and I think— I think them people going up and down know it, too, 'cause one time one of them caught me looking at him and he winked right at me and the... and he changed the colors of his left eye, right as I was watching him! It started out a chocolate brown but then it went all quicksilver for a moment, like the mercury the mages play with, and then he was gone and out the door, laughing his high-pitched laugh.~
@20243 = ~People see what they wish, and they really wish to see a savior. He offers stability and seems able to deliver. That is more than anyone has been able to give them so far. I tire of this chatter. If you feel you must strike me down, do as you wish. Do not expect me to wait around while you do it though.~

@20248 = ~Who are these people?~
@20249 = ~I will get to Sarevok eventually. I will destroy the network he has built first!~
@20250 = ~Piato~
@20251 = ~Well, mark my eyes now and mark them well. If they go all quicksilver when I come back down, take that dagger from your belt and gouge the offending eye from my skull quick as lightning, because it won't be my own. I don't know what's going on but you're right: it's creepy and, had I a choice, I'd want no part of it.~
@20252 = ~Why do you bother? He has abandoned us, and I would not be surprised if he turned us in to the Flaming Fist. He would be a hero yet again. People desperately want a hero, what with Entar Silvershield dead. I would not be surprised if Sarevok was behind it from the start, though he would have to kill the other Grand Dukes if he truly wanted free reign and command. I would not put it past him, though his ultimate goal is beyond me. Seems more interested in carnage than control. Are you through with me? I was in the process of leaving, if you don't mind.~
@20253 = ~Piato~
@20254 = ~Competition of the Iron Throne. Mostly members of the Seven Suns cartel or the Merchants' Consortium. They have both been attempting to negotiate a tentative peace between the different economic powers in the city. I fear it's not peace they're finding, however... at least not of the type they came looking for. Something's going on upstairs and I'd rather not think about what it could be.~
@20255 = ~Aye, friend. I wish we all had no part in it... But I have marked your eyes and your face as well. I pray they do not shift on me.~
@20256 = ~Something is rotten in the Iron Throne tower, something that is cancerous and malignant and... and growing. Dra'tan, one of the tower guards, has informed me of something most dire. It seems that the Throne has been inviting their competitors in the Seven Suns and the Merchants' Consortium to the tower's fifth floor and then doing something horrible to them. Are they being turned into zombies of a sort, are they being poisoned with a powerful drug, are they being replaced somehow? I don't know. Regardless, the implications are staggering and, to be honest, terrifying... I must steel myself and continue my ascent, however, for I know not what else to do...~

@20260 = ~Jessup~
@20261 = ~Why would he turn his back on the Iron Throne?~
@20262 = ~Because he was never interested in us in the first place. The iron shortage was to be an elaborate plan to gain power in the region. It was to strain relations with Amn, thus reducing the activity of the Knights of the Shield and ultimately reducing trade with them through "legitimate" means. We would step up to monitor the sanctions, and pocket hefty sums in the process. Such was the plan, but Sarevok apparently had other ideas.~
@20263 = ~Shistal~
@20264 = ~Shistal~
@20265 = ~It does not matter. I will fight him to the last.~
@20266 = ~The last what? Citizen? Flaming Fist soldier? He has them all in his pocket and they believe in him. He is to be a Grand Duke, stepping in to replace Entar Silvershield, and he has the full support of the people. He has promised to restore order, and since he created the chaos I am sure he will be fairly successful. I would not be surprised if he was behind Entar's death. Likely the other Dukes are in similar peril. Sarevok seems bent on causing destruction, and the smallest diversion is crushed viciously. I must go. I trust I am beneath your concern, so you will not kill me? I hope so.~
@20267 = ~Bendalis~
@20268 = ~Bendalis~
@20269 = ~What ideas? What do you know of his plans?~
@20270 = ~I know his methods, but I do not understand what he hopes to accomplish. Likely he assassinated Duke Eltan so he could step in, but political gain does not seem to be his goal. He would have had plenty of economic power as head of the Iron Throne, but money was not his concern either. He seems more interested in prolonging the tensions with Amn, though what a war would get him, I do not know. We are no longer in a position to profit from it. What do I care, I just want to leave before we're turned over to the guard. Goodbye.~

@20298 = ~It is hardly a secret. The Grand Dukes have sent me to negotiate a new iron treaty with Thaldorn. It appears that the Merchants' Consortium and the Seven Suns have voluntarily granted the Iron Throne temporary control over their mines in order to simplify the city's supply structure and thereby strengthen the war effort... should it come to that. I am here to ensure that we have access to that iron at a favorable price. The Iron Throne has been more than cooperative with us to date and I doubt that they will change their tune now. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have no intention of being late for my negotiations.~
@20299 = ~~ [AMB_E46B]

@20302 = ~How foolishly chivalrous of you, but I can take care of myself, thank you very much. Besides, I have an iron treaty to negotiate with Thaldorn and the Grand Dukes would hardly be pleased if I abandoned such an important duty for the likes of you, now, would they? If you insist on being as much of a boob and a dimwit as the others, then I shall find the silly stairs on my own.~
@20303 = ~What do you know of what happened there?~
@20304 = ~I'm sure you will, but you'll not find it here. Sarevok was the architect of that plot, and we are all victims of it. If you seek him, I would look towards the Ducal Palace. There is to be a coronation there soon, and it will likely give Sarevok power enough to do what he wishes in this city. I imagine the fates of the remaining present Dukes will be much the same as that of Entar as well. I hope you have proof enough to convince people of his evil. Your confrontation will be very short otherwise.~
@20305 = ~I know that you are the unwitting dupe of Sarevok, as were we. It would seem that he sacrificed our leaders just to discredit you, knowing that you were perhaps the only ones that stood in his way. Of course he also became our leader of the Iron Throne himself, but he seems quite beyond needing us now. Such disrespect, to throw us away as he did. It hardly matters now, what with his coronation imminent. I'm sure the Ducal Palace will never quite be the same. I must go. Pleasure chatting with you.~
@20306 = ~My apologies. I have a tendency of coming across as a bit gruff. It comes with the title of Chief Negotiator for the Grand Dukes, I'm afraid. You may call me Emissary Tar. Now please, if we could start over. Where might I find the stairs to the fifth floor as it seems I have lost them entirely?~

The Merchants' Consortium and the Seven Suns have temporary surrendered their mines to the Iron Throne, supposedly in support of the coming war effort.

My name is Destus Gurn, Assistant Chief Accountant for the Iron Throne's operations on the Sword Coast. Now, just a quick briefing on our negotiating procedures before you head on up the stairs: Thaldorn will be accompanied by a board of six Iron Throne advisors sent to us from abroad: Zhalimar Cloudwulfe, Gardush, Naaman, Diyab, Aasim, and Alai, all of them quite respectable men and eager to meet you. We also have a seventh member on that board, today, a Mr. Lyle Espejo. He is there to ensure that things go smoothly in this time of transition. As for the agenda—~

@20329 = ~On the agenda, as you well know, are a discussion of our current offer regarding iron prices and some notes regarding the output of the new mines we have acquired. Preceding all of that, however, Mr. Espejo would like to have a few words with you about the positive change and dynamism, economic and otherwise, that he has been witness to in his recent travels through the Sword Coast region. I do not doubt that you will find it interesting. But I have taken enough of your time. Please proceed upstairs so that the negotiations might begin.~
@20330 = ~Yes, true, very well then, Emissary Tar. Proceed upstairs and don't allow me to keep you here a moment longer. Great things are afoot and I am very proud to have met you on behalf of the Iron Throne and I hope, for everyone's sake, then, that the... negotiations... proceed swiftly, yes, thank you.~
@20331 = ~You... you killed Davaeorn? Oh... please don't kill me! Please oh please oh PLEASE! I'm just his apprentice, I swear! I don't know anything! Okay, I know a little, but I was only his student! Honest! I can... I can help you! Yeah, I can give you information! Ask me something! Go on, ask me anything!~

@20334 = ~Who are you? What was your role here?~
@20335 = ~Fear my wrath, for it is great indeed! Who dares intrude upon our negotiations?~
@20336 = ~My name is Emissary Tar. I am here to negotiate an iron treaty with Thaldorn on behalf of the Grand Dukes.~
@20337 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.~
@20338 = ~How many Emissary Tars do we have now? Three? Fool, Ms. Tar stands right before you and she was just leaving, weren't you, my dear? Honestly, this has gone on long enough.~
@20339 = ~And who are you to say so? I've crushed all those before you!~
@20340 = ~Certainly a little coin would ease your conviction a bit? A little gold to make you turn the other way?~
@20341 = ~I am quite sorry to have bothered you, really! Is this the exit? I'll just be going now!~
@20342 = ~I told you, I'm just Davaeorn's apprentice! I studied under him, and that's it! I didn't know anything about anything! Well, I know a little, but just ask and I'll tell you!~
@20343 = ~<CHARNAME>, you say? Ah yes, Sarevok warned us you might try to meddle. That meddling will stop here, however.~
@20344 = ~I am quite sorry to have bothered you, really! Is this the exit? I'll just be going now!~

@20346 = ~Certainly a little coin would ease your conviction a bit? A little gold to make you turn the other way?~
@20347 = ~I'm sorry. I'll— I guess I'm just going to be on my way, now.~
@20348 = ~It died and I am studying it.~
@20349 = ~You're studying it? What is there to study? It's a dead cat.~
@20350 = ~That's disgusting!~
@20351 = ~The bones, the muscle structure, the shape of it, how its fur lies, where its ears are placed, the length of its whiskers, the sharpness of its teeth. I must know it all, you cur, now leave me to it.~
@20352 = ~What was the purpose of this installation?~
@20353 = ~But why would you need to know that? Why would anyone?~
@20354 = ~The iron shortage! Who is behind it?!~
@20355 = ~Who is behind it? Um... well... the Iron Throne, I guess. Davaeorn ran this place for the regional bosses in Baldur's Gate. They used some strange potion to taint iron already stored, used Mulahey to keep new ore from being mined, and had the bandits raid any incoming trading caravans. It doesn't take long for perceived shortages to embellish real threats. You know all of this if you are the one who killed Mulahey. Can I go now?~
@20356 = ~You priests have gotten a lot stranger since I left.~
@20357 = ~Must you pry so hard, you meddlesome brat!? Thsss, forget the plan! I'll taste you now, I will, and study your dead flesh as I do the cat!~
@20358 = ~Then leave again and I'll not have to see your rotten face about me as I work.~
@20359 = ~You're disgusting, you whelp. Thsss, now leave me be before I peel your ugly face back from your skull!~
@20360 = ~Yesss, you useless flesh... go on your way; go play in the library like I hear you used to...~

@20362 = ~Emissary Tar~
@20363 = ~Oh <CHARNAME>, I heard you had returned! If only it weren't in such dark times. Something is afoot in Candlekeep; there is an unvoiced panic amongst those of us who still call these haunted halls our home. You must help us, I pray you.~
@20364 = ~Oh thank you thank you thank you! I promise not to get involved with people like this again, no matter how good the fringe benefits are! Yes sir, I'm reasonably sure I will be careful from now on! Thank you, goodbye.~
@20365 = ~It seems the Iron Throne is negotiating a treaty with the city's Grand Dukes. Is this simple treaty the key to ending all the unrest of the past season or is it just another link in the long chain of motivations? Will money satisfy the Throne's greed or is there something more behind it all? I have so many questions and, while I feel so close to finding answers, I somehow doubt that they will be quite as fulfilling as I hope...~
@20366 = ~This door leads back to the upper levels of the keep. From the looks of it, it is heavily warded. Luckily Tethtoril teleported you past such an obstacle. Common sense dictates that you make your escape through the opposite door.~
@20367 = ~I can barely write this for my trembling. Doppelgangers have infiltrated Candlekeep, have infiltrated my home, my childhood. I feel dirty, coated in a thin film of horror that I know I will never be able to wash off... It came in the form of one of the older priests, I forget his name. But that's not what's important; where there's one, there's many. It's a question of whom else they've claimed... and how long before they come for me. The one said something about a plan: I am to be framed for the murder of Rieltar, head of the Iron Throne's operations on the Sword Coast. He must be here, then, somewhere in the Central Keep. I know not how much time I have to find him but I doubt it will be long. Fie, enough of this foul pen! I must be off!~
@20368 = ~Anything, dear Parda. Just tell me how.~
@20369 = ~Why the panic? What is so wrong?~
@20370 = ~How. How... If only I knew! Go around, search about. You have been away for a time, perhaps your eyes will see things that we cannot. We have been here too long, we are blind to the malignancies for they have crept up so slowly and absorbed themselves into our gaze. But they are there. My eyes can't see them, my ears can't hear them but all that is in me screams with the knowledge that they are there! Now hush; no one must know that we've been talking.~
@20371 = ~I always suspected that Old Reader Parda had something of the sixth sense about him and now I know it to be true. He has found within him the very knowledge that it has taken me far over a month of travel to acquire—that something very wrong is happening here. Throughout the Sword Coast and in Baldur's Gate, especially. But right now, as I scribble this, I know as well as he that whatever it is that is so wrong is presently lurking here in Candlekeep and befouling the place with its very presence! I must uproot it and scorch the vicious weed before it spreads.~
@20372 = ~The Watchers... Some of the Watchers are so strange now and— and people that I've known and loved for years now pass me in the halls without greeting, without their usual silly story, without some discourse on their latest readings. At first I thought it was me but it's not me, it's them, I see it in their sidelong glance: disdain, jealousy, rivalry, these I could understand, I could make sense of... But they weren't what I saw in their beady eyes: I saw hunger, plain and simple. Now shush, no one must know that I have spoken with you.~
@20373 = ~Pang Wallen~

@20390 = ~Who are you to threaten us?~
@20391 = ~Someone told us that this would be the place to go.~
@20392 = ~Shut up and defend yourself!~
@20393 = ~Such anger and determination! I am Cythandria, consort to Sarevok. I have been with him since before he knew of his true heritage. The heritage YOU share with him. He will be pleased to know I have killed you... perhaps enough that I might become his favored one again.~
@20394 = ~So you're one of his bimbos. Who cares! Defend yourself.~
@20395 = ~I doubt you'll ever be his "favored one." Sarevok is evil to the core... help us defeat him, and we'll let you go free.~

@20397 = ~I am not without my defenses, <CHARNAME>. I am a conjurer of some proficiency, or so I've been told. Come, my minions; make short work of these intruders!~
@20398 = ~A very amusing notion. I would never betray my lord. Perhaps you should try your wiles on Tamoko, I'm sure she'd be more receptive to your overtures... I could never understand what Sarevok saw in her. Enough of that! Come, my beasties; let's make short work of these interlopers!~
@20399 = ~Who told you to come here?! Who betrayed my lord?! It was Tamoko wasn't it? I always knew her to be a traitorous whore! Well it matters little if she did or not, all that matters is that you will die!~
@20400 = ~Wait! Do not kill me... please. I... I will tell you where to go to find my lord. The Under... the Undercellar are where you wish to go. It is there that you will find Sarevok. You can reach the Undercellar through the sewers... Please let me go now... I am shamed by my lack of courage.~
@20401 = ~As you should be, coward. Now you die!~
@20402 = ~Give us all of your possessions and then get out of our sight!~
@20403 = ~You do not give mercy? You are more like Sarevok than he would have imagined.~
@20404 = ~<CHARNAME>, you look distressed. What is it, child?~
@20405 = ~Take everything! It matters little... my life is forfeit.~
@20406 = ~Nothing. It's nothing. I'm just finding it very hot in here.~
@20407 = ~There is trouble here, Chanter. You must help me.~
@20408 = ~Oh, get out of here, you sniveling wretch!~
@20409 = ~Arghh~
@20410 = ~Arghh~
@20411 = ~Hot? This keep suffers from as many chill drafts as it always has... You look feverish, <CHARNAME>. Go see one of the priests, that they might tend to it.~

@20423 = ~Who are you? What was your role here?~
@20424 = ~I'm sorry, the world has made a liar of me. In truth, my brow sweats more from fear than from fever. There is something wrong within these drafty halls and I fear I need your help.~
@20425 = ~What was the purpose of this installation?~
@20426 = ~Oh, please, no! I've told you everything! I'm just a lackey and I swear I'll be good from now on! Please!~
@20427 = ~Just get out of here, you coward!~
@20428 = ~I will not be persuaded! You will die!~
@20429 = ~You are right, I have felt it, too. Pray tell me how this aging frame can help you.~
@20430 = ~No! Must escape! How did that spell go...~
@20431 = ~I must know who has visited the Keep lately and where they have spent their time.~
@20432 = ~Get out, you cowardly weasel!~
@20433 = ~You will die for your part in their plan!~
@20434 = ~I don't know! I swear it! All I can say is that the regional leaders of the Iron Throne placed Davaeorn here! There are three of them, I think, but I don't know their names! Davaeorn was getting orders from someone else too, he complained about it a lot, but he never said a name or anything to me! Honest! The main building for the Iron Throne is in Baldur's Gate, somewhere in the southwest of the city, but I have never been there! I tell you true! Can I please go?~
@20435 = ~Cythandria~
@20436 = ~Cythandria~
@20437 = ~As Chanter, you know the history of this Keep better than any other. I have grown up here, I have played within its walls, but there were many places I was never allowed to go. I am older now and I will go where I must but please, are there any places in this Keep of which I was never told?~
@20438 = ~Unconscious~
@20439 = ~There have been a few nameless scullery maids, some new Watchers. As for visitors to the library, though, two men from the Iron Throne arrived, what was it, two days ago? Three? They're here for a meeting with two Knights of the Shield who I believe made their arrival yesterday. Much of their time has been spent on the third floor, arranging preliminaries for the meeting. A man named Koveras has arrived as well but he's mainly kept to himself, researching some of Alaundo's prophecies regarding the Time of Troubles, which we keep on the second floor. Other than that, well... there's only been you.~

@20446 = ~You will die for helping the Iron Throne!~
@20447 = ~But— what right have you to ask that, child!?~
@20448 = ~I'm not a child anymore, Chanter... The entire Keep is in danger, even its most secret and sacred places... Please, Chanter. Gorion would have had it so.~
@20449 = ~-sigh-... I am growing old and the young are not so young anymore, nor the carefree so carefree... Alaundo the Seer, the one who founded this fortress of knowledge and whose prophecies I chant each day, he is entombed deep in the bowels of this place... I tell you this, <CHARNAME>, because you're right, it is time you knew. But I beg of you, in Gorion's name, do not venture into those trapped and warded halls unless some higher power than myself bids you go. Your stepfather would never forgive me for your loss... I must go now, child— <CHARNAME>... It is time to chant the Seer's prophecies as I always have.~
@20450 = ~Stephan~
@20451 = ~Stephan~
@20452 = ~I always knew that this home of mine held deep secrets and now, by the Chanter's grace, one of these has been revealed to me. He tells me that the very rock below this Keep is perforated by crypts wherein lie what remains of Alaundo the Seer and who knows what else. How to enter these crypts, I do not know and how to survive their traps, I know even less. The Chanter has begged me not to enter them, on my step-father's honor... I can only obey—unless fate dictates otherwise.~
@20453 = ~The Chanter tells me that the men from the Iron Throne are on the third floor of the Central Keep, meeting with two others from the Knights of the Shield. About what, I cannot fathom but I suspect my path lies in their direction nonetheless. The Chanter also mentioned another stranger, a man named Koveras, studying the prophecies of Alaundo where they are kept on the second floor. Who's to say whether or not he is connected to this mystery? All the same, it is no doubt wise to be aware of his presence here.~
@20454 = ~It is a sad day here in the Gate. I am sure that none have gone through this tenday unchanged. It would seem the streets are no longer safe, even within our great walls.~
@20455 = ~What has happened to make you feel this way?~
@20456 = ~What has happened? You must have been under a rock for some time, stranger. Entar Silvershield has passed, murdered it is said! If a Grand Duke is not safe, how are the rest of us to function? What has happened indeed.~
@20457 = ~~
@20458 = ~<CHARNAME>, my child, look at you! Your face has gained some new lines since the days when I tutored you...~
@20459 = ~~
@20460 = ~~
@20461 = ~~
@20462 = ~Certainly it cannot be as bad as you say?~
@20463 = ~Not as bad as I say? When a Grand Duke can be struck down and the city guards can do nothing? It would seem to be even worse.~
@20464 = ~Aww, cheer up. A smile makes any day brighter.~
@20465 = ~Such unbridled optimism will likely get you slapped during this dark time. Entar Silvershield is dead, and when a Grand Duke can be assassinated what does that say about the state of affairs?~
@20466 = ~We'll leave, but don't think this is the last of it... it won't be, not by a long shot.~
@20467 = ~Please, stay back. You were my tutor once, but who you are now, I cannot know. I'm sorry Karan... but I can trust no-one.~
@20468 = ~Why? What is wrong here? Shall I tell the Watchers?~
@20469 = ~Koveras has suggested that I kill the leaders of the Iron Throne, while they're here at Candlekeep. The thought of bringing violence to such a place makes me queasy, but perhaps it's something that needs to be done. I wish Gorion was here to guide me.~
@20470 = ~How 'bout we just end all of our problems, right here and now. Draw steel and let's sort everything out with the sharp of our blades!~
@20471 = ~Koveras told us you were all but undefended here at the keep. We could kill you and probably get away with it.~
@20472 = ~Ah, Karan, you speak true but it's not your fault. You prepared me as well as you could for what lay beyond these walls... I just pray that I am prepared for what I shall find within them, now that I've returned.~
@20473 = ~Koveras! Who is Kove... of course. It seems that I taught my son all too well. Well my young pups, you've been set up to be used as dupes. Koveras does not want what's best for you, but rather what's best for him. Hmmm... well you should stop this foolish prattle about doing battle and get out of our conference room!~
@20474 = ~That's fine little ones, I'm sure we can expect to see you in the future, if not in person, then at least your heads.~
@20475 = ~Good riddance.~
@20476 = ~What has this world done to you, child? It is me... Karan... your tutor— I knew you as a babe.~
@20477 = ~As I told you before, get out and stop bothering us!~
@20478 = ~We don't intend to leave, we intend to kill you.~
@20479 = ~We'll leave, but don't think that this is over.~
@20480 = ~Forgive me, Karan. I am so filled with fear. This place is not the shelter it once was.~
@20481 = ~Flee, beast! I give you this chance only because I once loved the form you've taken. Begone, for such chances do not come twice!~
@20482 = ~The Watchers are no more use than a bundle of sticks. Please, just tell me if you have seen anything strange in the library this past while.~
@20483 = ~Yes, call the Watchers but first tell me if you have seen anything strange about the library today.~
@20484 = ~Strange? Why yes, that is just the word I would have used for that Koveras fellow. He was right here beside me, taking Alaundo's prophecies from their place on the shelf and reading them. I could hear his voice, recognize the Seer's words upon his quiet breath, but when I turned to steal a glance at him from the corner of my eye, it was the strangest thing: his eyes were closed and he was reciting page after page, as if from memory! He heard your footsteps, it seems, and wandered off... I was just returning the prophecies to their rightful place, here. It might be wise to take a look. If this Koveras is dangerous, though, I'm afraid I'm too old and bookish to be more than a hindrance. Forgive me, but I must leave you now.~
@20485 = ~What is happening in our fair city? Some Amnian plot I'll wager! We weathered their little iron plot, so they resort to assassinating our leaders! Duke Entar Silvershield is dead, Duke Eltan is gravely ill!~
@20486 = ~Strange? Why yes, that is just the word I would have used for that Koveras fellow. He was right here beside me, taking Alaundo's prophecies from their place on the shelf and reading them. I could hear his voice, recognize the Seer's words upon his quiet voice, but when I turned to steal a glance at him from the corner of my eye, it was the strangest thing: his eyes were closed and he was reciting it, page after page, by memory! He heard your footsteps, it seems, and wandered off... I was just returning the prophecies to their rightful place, here. It might be wise to take a look. Wait here, then, while I talk with the Watchers.~
@20487 = ~Do you think the two events are related?~
@20488 = ~More than likely. Eltan slips closer to death's door and our government is in shambles. It's a good thing that Sarevok fellow is stepping in. He seems a man to get things done. I'd follow him into battle if it cam to war with Amn. Did you know, they still have the nerve to deny they are behind it all? The curs!~
@20489 = ~Do they have suspects in the assassination?~
@20490 = ~They don't even have the first clue where to look for a suspect. That's why I'm glad that Sarevok fellow is stepping in. Him and the new leader of the Flaming Fist will get things done. They seem to work well together.~

@20496 = ~You picked the wrong time to come back, <CHARNAME>. There's trouble hereabouts.~
@20497 = ~Trouble? Of what sort?~
@20498 = ~I'm not surprised, friend. I hear the Iron Throne is here and where they go, trouble seems to follow.~
@20499 = ~Strange trouble. I don't feel comfortable in the barracks anymore. A lot of the Watchers have been acting weird of late.~
@20500 = ~Aye, Bruno and Rieltar... That's the trouble with this place: any rogue can come in 'ere, as long as 'e's got a pretty book to give. Keep your eye out for them. They looked like trouble.~
@20501 = ~Hmph. No one new here for over a month and now there's a wave of ye.~
@20502 = ~I'm hardly new here, Watcher. Now rein in your tongue, lest I inform the Gatewarden.~
@20503 = ~A wave, is it? Anyone from the Iron Throne?~
@20504 = ~Here to serve.~

@20510 = ~There are members of the Iron Throne within these walls, violating the sanctity of our precious library as we speak! Alaundo would not have tolerated such a blasphemy in Oghma's holy sepulchre! Steer clear from them, child, lest they infect you with their ways.~

@20513 = ~Scar told us that if we ever had any trouble that we could meet him just outside of the Flaming Fist compound in the south west portion of the city. He seemed to hope we were the ones who helped out in Nashkel. Perhaps I should tell him...~
@20514 = ~Please, do not disturb my contemplative ambling.~
@20515 = ~Scar has hired us to investigate strange goings on in the Seven Suns compound in the southwest section of the city.~
@20516 = ~You put your left foot in, you take your left foot out, you put your left foot in and you shake it all about— Oh! I, uh, didn't see you there... The wisdom of Oghma manifests itself in, uh, many ways... I'll be on my way, now.~
@20517 = ~What foolishness is this?! Are you trying to storm the Flaming Fist compound?! You'll find no friends here, <CHARNAME>! Angelo now commands the Flaming Fist.

@20531 = ~<CHARNAME>! Stop this madness, child, I beg of thee! Thou hast soaked these halls with the blood of innocents and I cannot permit it to go further.~
@20532 = ~What is it you want... Kent?~
@20533 = ~Idiots!~
@20534 = ~I remember the bunch of you from when you worked for Scar and Eltan. Well since you've been gone, things have gone downhill. Eltan's taken ill and he's resting in the room beside us. His healer Rashad keeps on saying that there's nothing he can do, but I know better. He's no healer from what I've seen. Anyhow, it don't matter, I've decided to desert the Flaming Fist before things get too hairy. I don't want to lose my life over whatever power struggle is going on in the city.~
@20535 = ~Stay back! Stay where you are! The one with you wears the face of my stepfather and I know him for dead!~
@20536 = ~Thanks for the information Kent, maybe we'll see each other again.~
@20537 = ~Why don't you think Rashad's a healer?~
@20538 = ~Reveal your true nature, doppelganger! You are no more an Elminster than I'm Drizzt the Drow!~
@20539 = ~Alright, I'll see you later. Good luck.~
@20540 = ~I followed him one night, all the way into the sewers. There he went into the Undercellar. Why would a healer be found in a whorehouse? I don't know what he was doing there, but it wasn't good whatever it was. I have to get going before my commander notices that I'm deserting. Perhaps we'll meet again.~
@20541 = ~Explain yourself! And if I see anything move besides your lips, I'll kill you where you stand or die trying!~
@20542 = ~Rashad, Eltan's healer, often visits the Undercellar, a seedy whorehouse accessible through the sewers of the city.~
@20543 = ~It's okay, <CHARNAME>, it's alright. I didn't die that night, nor have I yet. The blade that you thought slew me had been treated with a magical poison. It left me, a living soul and a lively mind, imprisoned in a body that gave all appearance of death. The man you saw that night is called Sarevok and he has been in the Keep for three days past under the reverse alias "Koveras." Tethtoril kept watch on him but, in our foolishness, we never thought that he might have others with him... Please, child, I have loved you too much to lose you now.~ [GORIN13]
@20544 = ~Elminster and I had suspected it for some time. With Sarevok away from his lair, Elminster was at last able to locate your step-father and bring him to safety... Forgive me, <CHARNAME>, I should have told you earlier. But to raise your hopes only to see them dashed to pieces all over again? There is too much heart left in this bony cage for me to have done that.~ [TETHT01]
@20545 = ~Please, child, sheathe those weapons and sheathe thy madness, too. Come with us and we shall see thee, at last, to safety.~
@20546 = ~Yes, Elminster. Guide me from this place of horror that I might spend a gentler moment at the side of my stepfather.~
@20547 = ~I know you, mirrorkin, and you be no more an Elminster than I'm Drizzt the Drow!~
@20548 = ~You said that these walls were soaked with innocent blood. Then who was it that chased me down these wretched halls, calling my name in voices I once knew, only to close and attack in trait'rous form?~
@20549 = ~By all that is good, <CHARNAME>, what have they done to your mind to haunt it so? Your old friend Dreppin lies tangled in his own entrails and foolish Phlydia, she ran down here to offer a mother's shoulder and you have butchered her like the monster you perceived her to be... The gods have no mercy on we ragged mortals, it appears.~ [GORIN05]
@20550 = ~Why are you so worried? It's not as if assassins are roaming the streets.~
@20551 = ~You... you look familiar. If I didn't know better, I'd say you were that group of hooligans that killed those fellows in Candlekeep! The Flaming Fist issued a description and sketches, and you're the spitting image! Get away from me!~
@20552 = ~Not polite to go about the city armed as you are. Can't say that I blame you though. Flaming Fist is in a mess right now and it's up to the citizens to take care of themselves in a lot of places.~
@20553 = ~Why is the Flaming Fist in such disorder?~
@20554 = ~You don't know? Scar, second in command of the Fist, was killed—I think murdered—not long ago, and Duke Eltan is still too sick to lead them. Angelo Dosan has stepped up to take the roll, but he seems to be in the back pocket of that Sarevok person. Not that this is necessarily bad. Sarevok seems like a man who gets things done.~
@20555 = ~What places do you mean? Where should I be careful?~
@20556 = ~Sorry traveler, but the entrance to Baldur's Gate is closed. With all of the bandit activity about, we've been forced to keep the gate closed. Perhaps if you return later, things may have changed and we may be able to re-open the city.~
@20557 = ~This is the city of Baldur's Gate! You have the mighty Flaming Fist to defend you. Why would you be afraid of bandit incursions?~
@20558 = ~Poor Eltan. Know what I heard? My sister is a friend of the Dukes maid and she said that Eltan is on death's door! He's got a healer with him always, but he doesn't seem to be getting any better. Rashad is the healer's name, and even though he seems well intentioned she also says that he's... well... just kind of weird.~
@20559 = ~Perfectly understandable. We'll return at some later date.~
@20560 = ~Normally what you have said would be true, but most of the Flaming Fist is down to the south, and the Grand Dukes feel that the city is exposed. I apologize for any inconvenience, but there is nothing I can do.~
@20561 = ~Good luck on your travels.~
@20562 = ~And Drizzt thou art not, thank goodness. As for this old rag-tag physique, thinkest thou that I would let anyone duplicate it without express permission? I have it copyrighted, thou must know... Come, poor soul, let us leave this darkness behind and struggle towards the light. The three of us shall guide thee.~
@20563 = ~Alright, Elminster. You have earned my trust and I shall follow you from this place.~
@20564 = ~Wipe such words of light from your spittled teeth, creature of darkness! I shall kill you in all your treacherous forms!!!~
@20565 = ~What about the one that wears the face of my stepfather like a mask? I know him for dead and only a mirrorkin would haunt me so!~
@20566 = ~What is going on here? I can't trust any one of you until I have some answers!~
@20567 = ~The whole city is on edge, so I would be careful everywhere. Things are really strange by the Iron Throne building though. I heard their leaders were killed or something. Sarevok has announced that he is assuming control of them though, and he's going to use their resources to help reinforce the city against Amn. He's making a lot of friends, and I bet he will be nominated to replace poor Entar as Grand Duke.~

@20571 = ~I am a doddering and elderly fool for having let it come to this! There stood I, Elminster the Arrogant, nudging and prodding but never taking action... The most powerful mage in the Realms reduced to a meager puppeteer... Listen close, <CHARNAME>: With the help of doppelgangers and some powerful magics, Sarevok has encased thee within a vast and frightening illusion. I was unsure whether I could even penetrate it to reach thee. The time has come for a leap of faith, child. Thou must fling aside this foul illusion and let us lead thee back to reality where Sarevok is fightable.~
@20572 = ~If you don't mind, I'm not in the mood for speaking right now.~
@20573 = ~What is wrong? The iron crisis is easing up and trade routes are opening again.~
@20574 = ~True, but whoever was behind the troubles before have now switched tactics. Since the iron crisis didn't weaken us significantly, they have turned to killing our leaders. Duke Entar Silvershield has been assassinated, and with Duke Eltan practically on his deathbed something must be done. An election of sorts has been called because we cannot be without a full government in these dangerous times. I hear Sarevok is a frontrunner in this matter.~
@20575 = ~I dream only of a warm bed and some light to wake me from this nightmare. I shall follow you, Elminster, and trust you fully.~
@20576 = ~If this is madness then leave me to it! If you flee now, I shall not attempt to kill you!~
@20577 = ~Stay close, then, <CHARNAME> and do not stray too far from me, for monsters, imagined and real, still lurk behind each corner. I will give thee further instructions when the time comes.~

We, that is, I am in need of favor from you. I have a money for pay and a big heart for friendship. Can you help a gentle fellow in search for knowledge?~
@20782 = ~Knowledge is a worthy pursuit my friend. I will help if I can.~
@20783 = ~Consult a library, sir. I have no time for such as you.~
@20784 = ~You mentioned money?~

@20786 = ~I would be interested to hear more about this "favor" that you would like me to do for you.~
@20787 = ~I have important business to attend to. Perhaps another time.~
@20788 = ~Tragic things are happening in this unfair, uh, how you say... world. The men with power, they hurt the men with none. They destroy things that teach us better life. I tell you true, it would be better if these men are not born!

This Merchant League, these bad men, they find the island to the west. The island has a broken ship, an, uh, shipwreck. Very old shipwreck, they say.~
@20789 = ~Get on with it man, you're as long-winded as Volo.~
@20790 = ~Out with it, man! You're as long-winded as Volo!~
@20791 = ~Please go on.~
@20792 = ~How did the Merchant League discover the island?~
@20793 = ~They sail to New World and big storm blow them north. The sailors can't control boat and it almost crash on island rocks. It is very stormy but they can see the old wrecked ship. They come back to Baldur's Gate and sell sea charts to Merchants' League. A pox upon them!~
@20794 = ~Why is the Merchants' League interested in an island in the middle of nowhere? What does it boast besides dangerous shores and a rotting ship?~
@20795 = ~Get to the point, windbag!~
@20796 = ~Where is this leading, sir?~
@20797 = ~These merchant men are greedy. They want island and ship. May their bones rot in the Nine Hells!

The merchants want treasures from the New World. The Trackless Sea is very wide, so Merchant League ships must stop for supplies. They would stop at Evermeet but elf place is north, too much. Only place to stop is Sundrah on Lantan but fees are very expensive. Merchant men lose money too much in Sundrah.

The Merchant sailors see more than shipwreck on island. They see big harbor, also. They want to turn this harbor into new stop for ships from Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate.~
@20798 = ~What about the shipwreck?~
@20799 = ~Why is all of this so important to you?~
@20800 = ~The Merchant League sailors see markings on the ship. The shipwreck, hero, is Balduran's. These men they think that Balduran had much treasure on his final voyage. Maybe this true, but ship also has many artifacts. These things hold knowledge of Balduran's fate. I wish to recover the ship's logbook. I will solve mystery of Balduran's final voyage. Merchant League will destroy my artifacts to get treasure. This must not happen! If you help me, I get things precious to me, you get treasure, merchant men get nothing.

You will help, yes?~
@20801 = ~I'm afraid I cannot help you at this time. Perhaps later.~
@20802 = ~Though foiling the plans of innocent merchants grates on my conscience, I will help you.~
@20803 = ~Mendas, you are clearly working towards a noble end. I will help you.~
@20804 = ~I've had enough of this, old man. Out of my way!~
@20805 = ~I am man of science. Merchant League men moved only by greed. They will destroy knowledge I need from the ship in their lust for wealth and trade advantage. Curse their black hearts!~
@20806 = ~What knowledge does a rotting shipwreck hold?~
@20807 = ~The petty squabbles of merchants and scholars matter not to me.~
@20808 = ~Ah, Fuernebol, my son. Trade your bow for a lute and play something mournful for your father, will ye?~

@20817 = ~You'll not have it. Stay back.~
@20818 = ~Your false innocence wears thin, mirror-thing. I know the face behind your face, the flicker of your eye. You're here to take my form and wear my helm atop your devil's head and I tell you again: You'll not have it...~
@20819 = ~Do not test my patience with your trickery, mirror-fiend, lest I kill you for your falsehoods. You are here to take my skin and claim my helm and walk amongst my kin in your disguise... Well, I have found you out, doppelganger, and you'll take no-one's skin today.~
@20820 = ~Aye, foul doppelganger, then I shall slay you in all your countless forms!~
@20821 = ~We'll not have what?~
@20822 = ~Calm down, we're not here to hurt you.~
@20823 = ~We'll have what we want, wraith. Return to the festering pits that bore you!~
@20824 = ~You are very rude for hero.~
@20825 = ~I charter boat forthwith. There is small problem, though. These men that find island, they keep the sea charts locked up. In Baldur's Gate, there is building in Northeast of city called Counting House; to find it just go northeast from Elfsong Tavern. The sea charts, they are in there. Most likely, captain of ship will have them.

I don't know such things as chart retrieval but you are hero and it is no problem for heroes. There might be small danger so I give you some gold for the charts. I will wait for you here.~
@20826 = ~I will not steal sea charts from the Merchant League! I would be no better than a common uh... well, merchant I suppose.~
@20827 = ~Consider it done. I will back as soon as I am able.~
@20828 = ~How much gold are you speaking of?~
@20829 = ~I can spare 2,000 gp for the charts.~
@20830 = ~I am on my way.~
@20831 = ~I am insulted that you think so lowly of me. Good day.~
@20832 = ~Back demons, and fly!! How many more of you defile my father's house?! ...Guards! Guards! Secure my mother's chambers!~
@20833 = ~You must try harder than that.~
@20834 = ~I can spare 3,000 gp for the charts.~
@20835 = ~I am insulted that you think so lowly of me. Good day.~
@20836 = ~You must try harder than that.~
@20837 = ~I am on my way.~
@20838 = ~Fuernebol, where are you? Into the escape halls!~
@20839 = ~Please hurry friends, I need charts soon. Merchants prepare ships as we speak.~
@20840 = ~Wonderful, my friends! I copy charts now. If you are ready, I hire boat for your journey. Here is the money I owe you: 2,000 gold.~
@20841 = ~I'm not ready for a journey yet.~
@20842 = ~I am ready. Where is your boat?~
@20843 = ~Mother!!~
@20844 = ~I hire boat at the docks here in Ulgoth's Beard. I meet you there soon.~
@20845 = ~Please reconsider, noble hero. There is much treasure and glory in this adventure.~
@20846 = ~Out of the way! Fuernebol!!!~
@20847 = ~Wonderful, my friends! I copy charts now. If you are ready, I hire boat for your journey. Here is your money: 3,000 gold.~
@20848 = ~I'm not ready for a journey yet.~
@20849 = ~Trust no one, father! The very flesh of our fortress has been breached!~
@20850 = ~I am ready. Where is your boat?~
@20851 = ~You are very busy, of course. Is 2,000 gp enough?~
@20852 = ~That is hardly reasonable compensation for the task. You'll have to do better.~
@20853 = ~I should be paid more for having to listen to you jabber. Pay up or find a new lackey.~
@20854 = ~2,000 gp will do nicely.~
@20855 = ~Please, kind hero, I am not rich. I am but a scholar. It is all I have.~
@20856 = ~It is banditry but I will accept.~
@20857 = ~Let us first discuss the mission then we will speak again of pay.~
@20858 = ~It is not enough. Good day.~
@20859 = ~Please, kind hero, I am not rich. I am poor scholar. It is all I have.~
@20860 = ~I suppose that it will do. I will go to this Counting House and retrieve the sea charts.~
@20861 = ~That is not sufficient for so dangerous an undertaking.~
@20862 = ~You make me bereft, sir, but I give maybe 3,000.~
@20863 = ~Perhaps. I need more information first.~
@20864 = ~That will be perfect. Who do you want killed?~
@20865 = ~I'm afraid my consulting fee is somewhat higher than 3,000. Perhaps I can help you when I'm not so busy.~
@20866 = ~Yes, of course, benevolent hero. There is task for me that you must perform.~
@20867 = ~Some strange apparition appeared to me.
This is what it had to say:

I am the warriors fate
I raise him above his brethren
I amplify his deeds
He becomes scornful, where once he had respect
He becomes a giant, where once he was a man.
Yet I lack the proper honor—Raise me up in glory
Through the chronicles of my deeds, pride shall be honored
Through the passing of knowledge my sword shall display my glory
Then you shall know that I am well pleased

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What would honor this warder? What will cause his sword, his Pride, to show his glory. He mentions chronicles of deeds. Obviously I must find and read these chronicles. The trick is in finding them. What could Durlag have intended with this puzzle? I must solve it to pass.~
@20868 = ~That is not what I require, excitable one. I will explain.~
@20869 = ~You would do well to listen to my proposal. There is much treasure involved.~
@20870 = ~Treasure, you say? Speak on, good man.~
@20871 = ~I care not. Begone!~
@20872 = ~Should you be interested later, I will be here.~
@20873 = ~How much treasure do you speak of?~
@20874 = ~Exactly how much gold could you spare for this dangerous task?~
@20875 = ~All is ready, friends. I pay for boat and I give copy of sea charts to you.~
@20876 = ~I have bought boat to use. It has food and water for journey. Everything is ready. You go now?~
@20877 = ~We need more time to prepare. Be patient.~
@20878 = ~Let us leave immediately.~
@20879 = ~We have decided not to go on your little excursion after all. Sorry.~
@20880 = ~To the Pits with your stupid quest!~
@20881 = ~Sword of Balduran~
@20882 = ~Sword of Balduran
This ornate, but poorly balanced, weapon was found within the wreck of Balduran's ship. Gold weapons are not known to be useful in combat, but legends say that only weapons forged of gold can harm such dread creatures as the Loup Garou.

@20924 = ~I am confused. Perhaps you could tell me your story.~
@20925 = ~Well, it turns out that the descendants of Balduran's crew still inhabit the island. They lived in two factions, one in the remains of the ship and one in a small palisaded village on the opposite end of the island.~
@20926 = ~I am merely concerned. I believe that it did not go well for me.~
@20927 = ~How so? We beat the Merchant League to the island and retrieved evidence regarding Balduran's final voyage.~

@20934 = ~Tell me more of inhabitants.~
@20935 = ~They said that they were the descendants of Balduran's crew. If you read the log you will discover that it wasn't a shipwreck that ended Balduran's final voyage: it was werewolves.~

@20943 = ~Ah, the village. You were met by a leader of the village, yes?~
@20944 = ~She was a werewolf bitch. She tried to make us one of her kind. We disagreed... strongly. Then she stole the sea charts from us, wanting to take her whole cursed clan back to the mainland on the boat that they built. So we killed her.~

@20946 = ~Yes, we were. A woman named Kaishas. Very pleasant, actually. She's a fine, upstanding member of society.~
@20947 = ~I want you to bring back descendants of Balduran's crew. They are invaluable to research.~

They haven't attacked for some time. They fear me, it seems, but the younger ones refuse to learn the lessons of their fathers. Periodically, I believe it to be every generation or so, they will attack and learn the lessons that those who came before have already learned.

@21024 = ~We came by boat but were shipwrecked by the seemingly all-too-frequent storms near this island. Perhaps you should tell me who you are.~
@21025 = ~We flew in on our pet crystal dragon, fool.~
@21026 = ~I could use retrieval, I suppose, but I'm hardly an artifact.~
@21027 = ~Could you tell us what happened on Balduran's final voyage?~
@21028 = ~Save your self-pity, old man. You'll get no sympathy from me.~
@21029 = ~Have you not seen the abominations? Lycanthropy is the disease I speak of. The wolf-men are everywhere. You must have encountered them.~
@21030 = ~Aye, we did. We fought them and won.~
@21031 = ~We met them right outside your home. In fact, we came to destroy them. We understand that their lair is on Balduran's ship.~
@21032 = ~Perhaps you should tell us your tale.~
@21033 = ~I can do little to help you against the more powerful lycanthropes. However, this wolfsbane charm will make the younger lycanthropes wary of attacking you. In return for this assistance, I must ask a favor of you.~
@21034 = ~Speak on, good sir, I am yours to command.~
@21035 = ~We don't need assistance if it has such strings attached. We'll be on our way then.~
@21036 = ~You can do your own chores, impotent elf.~
@21037 = ~We sailed to far Anchorome, 200 strong. We returned with half of our brethren dead on the Golden Land's shores. But Balduran was ever the successful adventurer. He wrested a king's ransom in treasure for the Cursed Lord's of Anchorome before we were forced back to the ship and expelled from their shores.

The Cursed Lord's power haunts me still. Those monstrosities out there are the product of our travails in Anchorome. 'Twas a bitter wind that carried us homeward and we reveled not in our newfound wealth.

We came upon this island quite by accident and stopped to renew our dwindling supply of fresh water. I led the landing party while Balduran set the remaining crew to repairing the sails and fishing for fresh food. My party was hardly out of earshot of the ship when the curse struck.

The blood still stains my robes...~
@21038 = ~You killed some of the beasts?~
@21039 = ~Aye, that's what I just said.~
@21040 = ~They bleed and die as surely as I stand here.~
@21041 = ~No, I was only joking. I've never seen these lycanthropes before.~
@21042 = ~By the Gods! If you are willing to fight these terrors then you must assist me.~
@21043 = ~I will fight them for a noble cause.~
@21044 = ~Must? You are hardly in the position to tell me what I must or must not do. Run your own errands, coward.~
@21045 = ~I have no fear of these cowardly beasties. Show me their lair and I will put them to the sword!~
@21046 = ~Your words bespeak a boorish demeanor. A demeanor not unlike that of Golodon the Unmanned. You'll not take me easily, mercenaries! This old dog still has teeth!~
@21047 = ~Truly, I am in your debt. The lycanthropes' lair is in Balduran's ship. My spell book lies within. With it, I am a powerful mage. Without it, I am the pauper that stands before you. These few wards I cast are gifts of pity from Selune. I have turned to the goddess in my fear and solitude. Perhaps my lengthy imprisonment is but a penance so that I might become worthy of the Goddess.

I digress. With my spellbook retrieved, I may be able to discover a way off of the island. If you go to destroy the lycanthropes' lair, I would ask that you find my book.~
@21048 = ~Where might this book be found in the ship?~
@21049 = ~I will be far too busy simply surviving. I can't help you.~
@21050 = ~Now that I know of your book's existence, I'll find it and use it for myself.~
@21051 = ~They changed, of course. It was so sudden. We were speaking about what we intended to do when we arrived home. Galan died first, his throat torn open by one of the changed men. I couldn't tell who killed him, of course, since they were unrecognizable in their changed forms.~
@21052 = ~I reached for the wand that I carried in my robes, but the abominations moved too quickly. Of the ten sailors in my party, seven were lycanthropes. We had no chance. Two of them leaped at me even while the others feasted on the bodies of my other sailors. I cast lightning with my wand and killed one of the shape-shifters. The other wolf hit me with great force. I was thrown back against a tree and I knew no more.~
@21053 = ~I awoke in the dark, several hours later. At first, I believed I was dead, but when I tried to rise, the pain in my head dispelled that myth. There was blood everywhere. So much blood. The body of the lycanthrope I had killed lay several feet away, draped over Galan's ravaged corpse. I retched at the sight of my friend, so cruelly killed.~
@21054 = ~I cast one of the few spells I had, invisibility, wagering that if a lycanthrope caught scent of me, they would believe that they were smelling nothing more than a corpse. I crawled painfully back to the beach. The ship was half sunk in the surf, a huge hole in her side, as if a giant had punched through her in a rage. There was a smoldering fire on the deck and in that sickly light I could see the bodies of the ship's crew, gutted and hung in the rigging like so much meat. Sickened and in despair, I crawled back into the woods.~
@21055 = ~Dawn arrived and I came upon this ancient village. This hut was sunk in the sandy soil, and I crawled inside to hide and barred the way behind me with my final spell. After a short and fretful sleep I managed to find where the hut had broken through into this cave. To this point, I have survived on this freshwater stream and a peculiar sightless fish that lives in the calm pools below.~
@21056 = ~In these five hundred years I have found some favor with Selune. She has granted me a few spells and wards to better protect my precarious home. I haven't left these caves for many years as I haven't the power to defend myself for long. Mayhaps you could remedy that.~
@21057 = ~No, I can feel it. It covers me...~
@21058 = ~I would be glad to help.~
@21059 = ~Not a chance! I'm not your lackey.~
@21060 = ~If you help us fight the lycanthropes then we will help you.~
@21061 = ~Uh, okay... you were saying?~
@21062 = ~You are insane.~
@21063 = ~Why don't you shut up and finish the story.~
@21064 = ~They swarm all over the island. You must have seen the beasts. Evil half-beast creatures? You are mocking me!~
@21065 = ~So what if I am?~
@21066 = ~Oh, those lycanthropes. I guess I have seen them. They are killable, though.~
@21067 = ~Don't accuse me, old boy.~
@21068 = ~My spellbook is in a chest in my cabin. The cabin is next to Balduran's on the level just below the decks. Please hurry back with it. This amulet is all that I can offer you as protection against the lycanthropes. Should you need to rest, I hope that my humble abode will serve you well.~
@21069 = ~Golodon, you eunuch rat-boy! I'll kill you!~
@21070 = ~I wish you'd reconsider. I could help you if you could help me.~
@21071 = ~Please go to the ship and find my spell book.~
@21072 = ~Are you willing to help me now?~
@21073 = ~Yes, I will help you.~
@21074 = ~Not at this time.~
@21075 = ~It is done! Freedom!~
@21076 = ~Are you intoxicated, sir?~
@21077 = ~Durlag Trollkiller~
@21078 = ~Durlag Trollkiller~
@21079 = ~You sure are big. Does Kaishas know that you're here? You should go and see her.~
@21080 = ~My name's Farthing. I'm only five. In a few years my papa will let me hunt. Are you allowed to hunt?~
@21081 = ~Just like me! We can be friends if you want. I've lost my dolly out in the woods. The gatekeeper won't let me go and get it. Can you get it for me?~
@21082 = ~You're lucky. I don't like you.~
@21083 = ~You're weird. What would we eat?~
@21084 = ~Thank you. You can play with dolly on the way back if you want.~
@21085 = ~You're mean. I don't like you.~
@21086 = ~You are weird.~
@21087 = ~I'm not talking to you.~
@21088 = ~You brought back my dolly! Thanks!~
@21089 = ~No, I'm only three so they only let me fish and play with dolls.~
@21090 = ~Indeed, little girl. I can hunt at will.~
@21091 = ~I believe that animals should be cherished and admired, not hunted and killed.~
@21092 = ~If I see it on my travels, I will bring it back to you.~
@21093 = ~I have more important things to do, little girl.~
@21094 = ~There is an enchanted bush in Shaar that grows a strange and wonderful food called Tofufruit. Should you find that unappealing there is mystic Couscous and holy Bean Sprouts. These and other wonderful, bland foods await one who renounces the flesh of innocent animals.~
@21095 = ~Out with it, man! What happened?~
@21096 = ~Excuse me for interrupting, but your robes seem to be perfectly clean to me.~
@21097 = ~Perhaps using a bib could help you avoid those unsightly stains.~
@21098 = ~Vegetables and mayhaps some fish, but that's it.~
@21099 = ~Thanks for my dolly! I'm so happy you brought it back... I just want to hug you and... er... pet you and stuff. Bye bye.~
@21100 = ~Hello to you that do not belong. I greet ye, and ask your purpose to be here. We are wary of those strange to us, and some may fear your coming. Please assure my worry you are not here to harm.~
@21101 = ~You do not belong, and yet you are here. What is your reason? Have you come to harm? Say otherwise and calm my fear.~
@21102 = ~You smell of the outside. You do not belong. What do you want here? We will not let you harm the home.~
@21103 = ~You killed the bad people and brought my dolly back... wow, you're real heroes now.~
@21104 = ~We will not harm you. Our ship foundered and we washed ashore on your island.~
@21105 = ~My purpose here is my business and not yours. It's bad enough we were shipwrecked on this backwater island.~
@21106 = ~I am not interested in you at all. I am here for other reasons, and I have only disturbed you because we were shipwrecked.~
@21107 = ~We will not harm you. Our ship foundered and we washed ashore on your island.~
@21108 = ~My purpose here is my business and not yours. It's bad enough we were shipwrecked on this backwater island.~
@21109 = ~I am not interested in you at all. I am here for other reasons, and I have only disturbed you because we were shipwrecked.~
@21110 = ~We will not harm you. Our ship foundered and we washed ashore on your island.~
@21111 = ~My purpose here is my business and not yours. It's bad enough we were shipwrecked on this backwater island.~
@21112 = ~I am not interested in you at all. I am here for other reasons, and I have only disturbed you because we were shipwrecked.~
@21113 = ~Then you are as we, for our beginning was as yours. Long have we been on this home, but not always. The mothers of our great-grandmothers were from away, but traveled near and the depths swallowed their ship. Accursed cliffs below have sharper teeth than we.~
@21114 = ~Outsiders? Hmph. You should speak with headwoman rather than wander about.~
@21115 = ~Your voice is rude, and will not collect much respect from we if you do not tame it. You are granted pardon because you are like us long ago. The mothers of our great-grandmothers came to this home as you, with ship in pieces behind. Many paddled with, and formed the home you see. The children have never seen the muzzle of an outsider.~
@21116 = ~I welcome you to village and I wish you luck in battle with evil that ship holds. I am Evalt, I fish for clan in these savage waters.~
@21117 = ~The island is not too big. With good wind I sail around it in afternoon. There is a natural harbor on north of island and on east of island. The ship of my grandfathers, of Balduran, lies beached in north harbor. The east harbor holds our hope for survival.~
@21118 = ~If you leave we alone, then you shall have the same. You are near kin because we came here as you did. Many changes ago the mothers of our great-grandmothers came in on tide with ship in pieces behind.~
@21119 = ~The island is very dangerous outside of village. The monsters that live in ship will kill and eat anything that they catch. Listen, outsider, may I ask you for help?~
@21120 = ~Perhaps it is better that we live far away from you people. Our ways are not barbaric as yours are.~
@21121 = ~You were shipwrecked? How long ago? I have come looking for an ancient shipwreck.~
@21122 = ~Unless you can build a boat strong enough for open sea travel, then you are trapped here with us. We attempt to build a boat for whole clan to sail on. Perhaps I should tell you more about island, yes?~
@21123 = ~You were shipwrecked? How long ago? I have come looking for an ancient shipwreck.~
@21124 = ~You were shipwrecked? How long ago? I have come looking for an ancient shipwreck.~
@21125 = ~I know that you may not believe my story; no one else on island does. My brother left village two nights ago and has not returned. I know where he has gone though I am ridiculed if I should say.~
@21126 = ~So be it. I will brave this danger alone.~
@21127 = ~A shipwreck! That is what I search for! Where in this pathetic little town have you hidden it?~
@21128 = ~Good people, there is a witch on this isle. My brother called her the Blue Lady and those of us who ply these waters have all heard her singing at one time or another. My brother, Evan, heard her more than most. I think that he went to find her. I think that he is under her spell. I must go and find him. This witch might kill him. He is strong but he is under her spell. I fear that she will kill him before he realizes what is happening. Can you find my brother?~
@21129 = ~A shipwreck! That is what I search for! Where in this pathetic little town have you hidden it?~
@21130 = ~I don't know exactly where she is. I have the sense to avoid her, unlike Evan. But I have only heard her singing along the west coast of the island.~
@21131 = ~A shipwreck! That is what I search for! Where in this pathetic little town have you hidden it?~
@21132 = ~It is as I feared. Thank you for returning his body. I am in your debt, friends.~
@21133 = ~Have you found Evan yet?~
@21134 = ~Who dares to come unannounced? Torture and death to all who intrude upon bloody Karoug!~
@21135 = ~We are the party of <CHARNAME>. We have come to put an end to your reign of terror over this island.~
@21136 = ~Names matter not to the dead.~
@21137 = ~It is a pleasure to meet you, Evalt. What can you tell me about the island?~
@21138 = ~We are strangers shipwrecked on this island and you are obviously the most powerful ally around. We wish to join your clan.~
@21139 = ~A common fisherman, eh? No point in talking with you, is there?~
@21140 = ~You have? How you know of this place? We are undisturbed for age upon age, but you know of our wreck?~
@21141 = ~We wish to join you.~
@21142 = ~Well met! We are the party of <CHARNAME>. As you may have heard, we came here seeking knowledge of Balduran's final journey and were shipwrecked on the reefs in a violent storm. Tell me, sir, is there anyway off of this island once we find the things we seek?~
@21143 = ~I say you should speak polite. I suffer your company because you are stranded as we. I will not hear more of this. As for our ship-home, how did you know of this? We have not sensed an outsider before you. If we could have been rescued, why were we not?~
@21144 = ~Certainly, what is it?~
@21145 = ~I have important things to accomplish so I'm afraid that I can't help you.~
@21146 = ~A merchant ship sailed close during a storm and spotted it. It bears the markings of Balduran, a hero that went missing some three hundred years ago. A man named Mendas hired me to find it. His accent is not unlike yours.~
@21147 = ~Silence, dog-boy! You and your bitch die now!~
@21148 = ~Reign of terror, outsiders? You speak to Kaishas, yes? She tell you lies about my people. It is not truth. Karoug will tell you truth.~
@21149 = ~A merchant ship sailed close during a storm and spotted it. It bears the markings of Balduran, a hero that went missing some three hundred years ago. A man named Mendas hired me to find it. His accent is not unlike yours.~
@21150 = ~You have my attention. Go ahead.~
@21151 = ~Please do.~
@21152 = ~I'll not listen to your lies, murderer. My weapons do the speaking now.~
@21153 = ~A ship sailed close during a storm, but could not land. They saw an old shipwreck, but no sign of you or anyone else. We came to investigate and possibly gather salvage from the wreck.~
@21154 = ~A ship sailed close during a storm, but could not land. They saw an old shipwreck, but no sign of you or anyone else. We came to investigate and possibly gather salvage from the wreck.~
@21155 = ~If you aren't evil after all, then I bid you farewell.~
@21156 = ~I doubt very much that I need the assistance of anyone who reeks so strongly of fish.~
@21157 = ~I did not know, but I am always on the lookout for a salvage opportunity.~
@21158 = ~I will drink your life force, outsider!~
@21159 = ~Fear no ridicule from me, Evalt, I have seen many strange things.~
@21160 = ~I did not know, but I am always on the lookout for a salvage opportunity.~
@21161 = ~What you say may well gain you ridicule. How shall I know unless you tell me?~
@21162 = ~Mmm... perhaps I permit this. But you must do something for me.~
@21163 = ~No, I can't find him. My time is too valuable to be running about wasting it on the search for none-too-bright fisherman.~
@21164 = ~What would that be?~
@21165 = ~Tell me where this witch is and I shall try to find her.~
@21166 = ~No chance, puppy! Eat steel!~
@21167 = ~Not yet but I will.~
@21168 = ~~
@21169 = ~Welcome to our humble village. The headwoman will want to see you.~
@21170 = ~Stay away from my garden. I don't want my vegetables to be trampled upon.~
@21171 = ~The wolf monstrosities killed my wife. Will you send a few of them to the Hells for me?~
@21172 = ~It is about time that someone avenged her. Without her the fields are that much harder to keep healthy.~
@21173 = ~I would if they would allow me to leave the village. Now get away from my garden!~
@21174 = ~I'll expand my garden once you kill the evil ones. I haven't been able to leave the walls before.~
@21175 = ~Good crop this year.~
@21176 = ~Be careful when you leave the village. There are monsters everywhere on this island.~
@21177 = ~Thank you for destroying those terrible beasts. To tell you the truth I didn't think much of you when you first arrived, but now, I have to say you'd make welcome additions to the pa... er... village.~
@21178 = ~Your wife will be avenged.~
@21179 = ~An honorable man would take his own revenge.~
@21180 = ~Don't worry about your garden, we're not here to trample it. Your headwoman has asked us to defeat the monstrosities on the other side of the island.~
@21181 = ~Sorry about that, we'll just leave you alone.~
@21182 = ~Things will be better for you once we've killed those beasts.~
@21183 = ~Before I go, is there anything you can tell me about the island outside of the villages walls?~
@21184 = ~It is not wise to leave without the permission of the headwoman.~
@21185 = ~Go well, friends. May the wolf monsters be like blades of grass before your scythe. When you come back to the village, I will be here to greet you.~
@21186 = ~Hail, mighty heroes! My duty here is done. The gates stay open forever more!~
@21187 = ~Kiel the Legion Killer~
@21188 = ~Kiel the Legion Killer~
@21189 = ~I'm not going to run errands for you. You're lucky that I'm willing to join you at all.~
@21190 = ~It will never be! Now you die!~
@21191 = ~They have told you that my people are evil but truth is different. They hate us because we are not like them. They kill us on sight. They set fire to our home. You should kill the others; we are innocent. We kill only to defend.~
@21192 = ~From the mainland ye be? Never thought I'd see the day. Kaishas'll be wanting to see ye. Come back and indulge an old man when ye be finished with the headwoman.~
@21193 = ~Intrepid explorers, are ye? Not sailors, though. Ye don't have the walk. A sea dog like meself would know. I am Taloun, once a sailor of Amn, and now a proud member of this clan.~
@21194 = ~Why were we attacked by your "people" outside? They asked us no questions before attacking.~
@21195 = ~Aye, it's true. I was once a sailor for Sybarr Spices out of Amn, bringing product from the New World. Many seasons have passed since then. Everything be different now. Everything...~
@21196 = ~That story is quite different according to our knowledge. In fact, we were told that you killed a hunter and took his child. The child that I see you holding matches the description. How would one explain that contradiction?~
@21197 = ~Enough of this charade! Your evil ends today.~
@21198 = ~As ye will. Enjoy your stay. Heh, heh.~
@21199 = ~You leave now. But I tell you true, I kill you if you enter this room uninvited again.~
@21200 = ~Listen, stranger, as rude as ye be, I will offer ye the advice that I never got. Watch yourself. Nothing on this island be as it seems. Not these people, not the monsters and not meself. Do what you must quickly. Ye don't have much time.~
@21201 = ~We sailed to Maztica and returned, laden with spices. The ship was attacked by a kraken and dragged beneath the waves. Those of us that survived were pulled, one by one, into the kraken's beak to be eaten. I clung to some of the ships planking and somehow the kraken missed me. I drifted for days, eating me shoes and drinking only rainwater.~
@21202 = ~Eventually I drifted to this island. I gained membership to the clan by showing the villagers new techniques for fishing and farming. The clan has been here since Balduran's time ye understand. They be sorely in need of the little bit of modern technology that I be having. It is a fantastic tale, I admit, but I swear it is true.~
@21203 = ~Insolence! You will suffer for it, outsider!~
@21204 = ~Will ye then? Best of luck to ye, though I know it will help ye not.~
@21205 = ~You come to my home with weapons drawn. We must defend this ship from danger. You would do same in your home.~
@21206 = ~I know only a bit of the story, meself. They are very tight-lipped about the details surrounding their entrapment here. The crew stopped here to replenish supplies. They were attacked by savage lycanthropes; wolves that could turn into men if they so desired. In the battle, the ship was torched and the wolf beast chased the crew to this end of the island. The combatants fought to a standstill. The crew built this village and the wolf beasts took over the ship. Betwixt skirmishes life went on. The female crewmembers took husbands and started families. Things remain much the same today.~
@21207 = ~It isn't so simple, ye landlubber. Balduran and his guide Dradeel went missing in the battle. No one knows where this isle lays, for certain. Nevertheless, an attempt has been made. The fisherman, under my tutelage, built a small boat. Selaad Gan, our headman and husband to Kaishas, sailed for the mainland nearly a year ago. We have not heard from him. He is assumed to be dead.~
@21208 = ~Well put and entirely unbelievable. The dance of words ends and the dance of death begins.~
@21209 = ~I would give an intruder the opportunity to explain themselves first.~
@21210 = ~You do not kill my family and dare to question me! Die if you cannot understand.~
@21211 = ~I can say no more at this time but I will offer ye the advice that I never got. Watch yourself. Nothing on this island be as it seems. Not these people, not the monsters and not meself. Do what you must quickly. Ye don't have much time.~
@21212 = ~I be busy now. Leave me be.~
@21213 = ~Be proud, young ones. Ye have done a great service to the clan.~
@21214 = ~My family and I are trapped on island for many, many, years. We saw your shipwreck, you are trapped here, too. The others have built boat. They will not allow us to sail with them. They must die so that we may live.~
@21215 = ~Destroy them all. Only then may you join us in glory and freedom.~
@21216 = ~Thank you, Karoug. You have proved your utter uselessness beyond any shadow of doubt. This room will make a fitting grave for your rotting carcass.~
@21217 = ~As you say, we are not professional sailors. Do you mean to imply that you are?~
@21218 = ~Absolutely, Karoug. I'll depopulate the entire island for you. I'll see you in one hour. No one can possibly destroy an entire island. Your suggestion is ludicrous.~
@21219 = ~Mind your own business, old man.~
@21220 = ~You seem to have knowledge of life off of this island. Is there a tale to go with it?~
@21221 = ~Well, that's all very sad. However, rather than whining, I will discover a way to escape the island.~
@21222 = ~I don't wish to interrupt your melancholy, but how did you end up on this island?~
@21223 = ~You were warned.~
@21224 = ~What can you tell us of Balduran's final voyage?~
@21225 = ~You dare to mock Karoug?~
@21226 = ~Why is it that these descendants of Balduran's crew haven't been able to escape the island? For that matter, why did the original crew not build a boat and sail for home?~
@21227 = ~Your tale reeks of untruth. Krakens? Eating one's shoes? Only a fool would listen to you.~
@21228 = ~You're beginning to bore me, old man. You'll have to excuse me now.~
@21229 = ~Why didn't the crew build another boat and escape their fate?~
@21230 = ~Is there anything else we should know?~
@21231 = ~Mind your own business, old man.~
@21232 = ~Well, that's all very sad. However, rather than whining, I will discover a way to escape the island.~
@21233 = ~You're beginning to bore me, old man. You'll have to excuse me now.~
@21234 = ~Please, I may not speak with you. You must speak with the headwoman.~
@21235 = ~You are from the land of our grandmother's ancestors. I am honored that you will fight for my clan.~
@21236 = ~Good stranger, I must work now.~
@21237 = ~Will you save us from the beast ones?~
@21238 = ~You are brave and noble.~
@21239 = ~Your jests are confusing.~
@21240 = ~Perhaps we will have some freedom now. Thank you, strangers.~
@21241 = ~The party of <CHARNAME> will always be revered in this clan.~
@21242 = ~There will be a grand feast tonight. I must prepare some food.~
@21243 = ~A merry band of heroes ye be! Have I got the adventure that'll make ye yearn for glory! I am Hurgan Stoneblade, presently residing in Citadel Adbar.~
@21244 = ~Well met! What adventure do you speak of?~
@21245 = ~No offense, but we're not looking for a new adventure right now.~
@21246 = ~I've no desire to speak with you, dwarf.~
@21247 = ~A glorious adventure indeed. Ye have heard of Durlag's Tower, mayhaps?~

After Durlag built the tower his family was replaced by doppelgangers. Durlag killed them all but was driven mad by the act. He entrapped his tower heavily and forgot about me granda's dagger.~
@21260 = ~When I heard the story as a youth, I went to retrieve the dagger meself but was driven back by Durlag's devious traps. If ye be interested, I wish to hire ye to retrieve me granda's dagger, "Soultaker," me birthright. The tower has been penetrated somewhat by previous adventurers.

@21292 = ~I care not for your inbred clan. Leave me or face my wrath.~
@21293 = ~It is as I feared. Listen to me, we haven't much time. The ones who stole the dagger from you are the same that released the demon that killed me granda. Me granda was killed by a tanar'ri, a nabassu to be precise. The one who stole it from you is a member of a cult that worships this beast as a god. Many centuries ago, when me granda adventured with Durlag, they fell foul of the tanar'ri, which had been released on our plane by the cult. Durlag and me granda defeated the tanar'ri, though granda was mortally wounded, and they entrapped the demon's essence in a dagger. Me da later found a way to destroy the dagger and the beast within, but tragedy befell Durlag before he could send the dagger to me clan.~
@21294 = ~Ye must find the cult. Ye must retrieve the dagger that I might destroy the beast. If the cult manages to free the demon then it must be killed before it visits destruction upon our land. Go and get the dagger. Quickly!~

Upon hearing that a red dragon was ravaging the countryside, Pellan mounted his horse and rode off to do battle. Pellan and his armor digested readily but the shield gave the dragon severe stomach cramps. He coughed it up and it lay in his treasure pile for several years until it was retrieved by Pellan's son, a paladin who knew when to sneak.
The superior craftsmanship is supplemented by a permanent lightness spell, which makes the shield very easy to wield.

@21463 = ~Don't flatter yourself, Fenrus. We just want some information and we want it now. Stop feigning importance and tell us what you know of the Tower.~
@21464 = ~Then I shall have to go without your knowledge.~
@21465 = ~Thievery! Surely you hold no knowledge that is worth more than 50 gold. Away, hag.~
@21466 = ~100 gold then. Will that do?~
@21467 = ~I can say nothing more that will help ye.~
@21468 = ~They did, and now our way is clear. We can escape as soon as you show us where your new ship is.~
@21469 = ~I have not killed them all yet. I will keep trying.~
@21470 = ~I met a strange mage out there. He was mad from isolation, but he had much to say.~
@21471 = ~Greetings, adventurers. You must excuse me if I've nary a happy word to share this day. There has been a loss in the family, you see.~
@21472 = ~Noble people, I beg your forgiveness for my grim visage. There has been a disappearance in my family. I still mourn the loss.~
@21473 = ~Please leave me be. I am in mourning.~
@21474 = ~Unless you wish to search for my errant son, then no.~
@21475 = ~May your stay in Ulgoth's Beard be happier than mine.~
@21476 = ~I have done nothing to deserve such unkindness. Leave me to my mourning.~
@21477 = ~I have, or perhaps I should say had, a son named Dalton. He fell in with a crew of adventurers from Waterdeep. Dalton was always obsessed with the idea of being a hero. Alas, he has neither the brains nor the ability. Such is a mother's lot in life however, to watch her children perform acts of idiocy despite her warnings or concerns.~
@21478 = ~My poor boy took those acts of idiocy to the extreme. He and his thickskulled cohorts took it upon themselves to plumb the depths of Durlag's Tower. They bought a ward token from that shyster, Galken, and made ready to leave. Though I begged and cried, Dalton still insisted on going. The band never returned. I fear that they were destroyed by the mad dwarf's machinations. That is the tale, sad but true.~
@21479 = ~If you say so. Excuse me.~
@21480 = ~Thank you so much. Such kindness from strangers is unheard of in this harsh life. I will await Dalton's return with breathless anticipation.~
@21481 = ~Thank you for rescuing Dalton. He arrived back here just a few days before you did. The tales he had to tell were quite fantastic: demon knights! Well, it was nice seeing my son even if wasn't for long. Here is some of my savings for your time.~
@21482 = ~Your rescue may have been in vain, however. Dalton has set off in search of adventure again. That stupid, stupid child.~
@21483 = ~I must return to my worrying. Excuse me.~
@21484 = ~Worry not, lady. Is there anything that we could do to help?~
@21485 = ~Worry not, lady. Is there anything that we could do to help?~
@21486 = ~Worry not, lady. Is there anything that we could do to help?~
@21487 = ~I see. We shall not bother you any longer, in that case.~
@21488 = ~I see. We shall not bother you any longer, in that case.~
@21489 = ~I see. We shall not bother you any longer, in that case.~
@21490 = ~I care not for your petty problems. I have questions that need to be answered.~
@21491 = ~I care not for your petty problems. I have questions that need to be answered.~
@21492 = ~I care not for your petty problems. I have questions that need to be answered.~
@21493 = ~Tell us the tale and we might be able to help.~
@21494 = ~As you will. Good day.~
@21495 = ~I wish I could help, but we have other concerns at present.~
@21496 = ~Rest easy, woman. We will find your son if he still lives.~
@21497 = ~He deserved his fate. Cease your pointless weeping.~
@21498 = ~Believe him not! He does not belong! He is as mad as the beasts and almost as dangerous.~
@21499 = ~He said that it was not a reef that claimed your original ship. The beasts were aboard, and killed the crew.~
@21500 = ~I will mention it no more. He was clearly deranged.~
@21501 = ~Enough of him, then. I did kill all the beasts, as you had asked.~
@21502 = ~I have not killed them all yet. I will keep trying.~
@21503 = ~He must have been. He does not belong, and the isolation has harmed his sense. Were you successful at killing the beasts?~
@21504 = ~I was. Our way is clear and we can leave as soon as you show us where the new boat is moored.~
@21505 = ~Halt, land-dwellers. Who gave you leave to approach my home?~
@21506 = ~Not yet, but I will continue trying.~
@21507 = ~The strength of my steel gave me leave. We have come to retrieve a fisherman named Evan, whom you have lured here with your foul magic.~
@21508 = ~Sorry, I thought this was the local tavern.~
@21509 = ~I am <CHARNAME> and these are my companions. Perhaps you could explain what happened to that fellow behind you.~
@21510 = ~You are not of his kind; why do you care about this beast?~
@21511 = ~I will no longer consort with such as you. Leave me to my solitude.~
@21512 = ~Please do so. We must be free of this place. A home it has been, but we long to run in new woods.~
@21513 = ~Your questions are insulting. Give us the body or die.~
@21514 = ~There were deaths when we came to this place, but I assure you, only those that live in peace survived. We fled the sinking ship-home and began life anew. There were those that could not belong, they did not wish to join and threatened the founders with death.~
@21515 = ~We are here to bring that man home to his family, witch. What have you done to him?~
@21516 = ~You're right. We aren't from the island. We came to find this man, or at least his body, at the request of his brother, Evalt. He appears to be dead. Perhaps you could explain the events that led to his death.~
@21517 = ~Everything worked out for the best, then. You survived and built this fine home. I will continue to help you.~
@21518 = ~You accuse me of foul play? I fought to defend myself from this monster. I will defend myself from you if need be.~
@21519 = ~What do you mean by not being able to "belong"?~
@21520 = ~The evidence of your foul play lies on the rocks beside you, blue-skinned wench. You will pay for your crimes.~
@21521 = ~Then you are truly deserving. No more thought of fight or flight, for now you will belong as we. Hear the tale, and join our humble legion.~
@21522 = ~How can you claim self-defense when it was you who lured him here with your song in the first place?~
@21523 = ~Perhaps we spoke out of turn. If you killed him in self-defense then we only wish to retrieve the body and leave you be.~
@21524 = ~I doubt that you would understand. Nevertheless, I will attempt to explain. I am a Sirine, and as such must mate with a human male. My song lures them to me and the males are most happy to oblige. Normally, both parties will benefit from the exchange. It is my time to mate so I lured this fisherman to me. He attacked me and tried to force himself upon me. When my song no longer affected him, I took more drastic measures. This monster deserved to die. Perhaps even land-dwellers can understand that.~
@21525 = ~They did not wish to become as we are. They fought our mothers' grandmothers without thought, and would not reason. Balduran led them, and because of his leadership many on both sides died. I do not know his fate; only that he killed many, and so the ancestors left him to his sinking ship. He would not belong, and now we know not to ask. You will know peace with us, because we do not wish to harm our saviors. You who would help us to leave.~
@21526 = ~You did what you had to do. We would have done no less. We wish only to retrieve the body and leave you be.~
@21527 = ~Now you will belong. It not so bad, and you will begin to feel as we in a short time. It may be... unstable for a time. You may... hurt... but you will live, and we shall all go to new forests and plains with your maps and our ship-home. I will hold the sea charts for now, please you will give. We welcome you to wolfen-kind, and to family you now belong. The beasts you have killed were animal and evil, but we are proper lycantho, and noble in our peace.~
@21528 = ~A likely story, murderess. Your lies are useless against me.~
@21529 = ~You lured that man to you by magic. Obviously your magic failed and he fought to be free of your spells. I shall avenge his death, temptress.~
@21530 = ~What have you done?! I will fight you to the death! I will never "belong"!~
@21531 = ~He is a beast. He had to die.~
@21532 = ~You did what you had to do. We would have done no less. We wish only to retrieve the body and leave you be.~
@21533 = ~You have infected me with... lycanthropy?! You are utterly evil!~
@21534 = ~A likely story, murderess. Your lies are useless against me.~
@21535 = ~You lured that man to you by magic. Obviously your magic failed and he fought to be free of your spells. I shall avenge his death, temptress.~
@21536 = ~That doesn't sound too bad, I suppose. We shall be free to run...~
@21537 = ~Well-spoken, land-dweller. You may have the monster's corpse if such is your wish.~
@21538 = ~Can you not sense what the man was? If you consort with such then the sea cries for your death, as well.~
@21539 = ~You bestow an injustice upon me. I did not wish to kill you, but you forced my hand.~
@21540 = ~You there! Where do you think you're going?~
@21541 = ~Ungodly ones! This place is not for you. Leave immediately.~
@21542 = ~Look elsewhere. This is private property.~
@21543 = ~You! The usefulness of your party is exhausted. Our god will suffer no intrusions.~
@21544 = ~Do not profane this holy place with your corrupted suggestions. Begone!~
@21545 = ~People like you will be cleansed from this world with fire and blood when the new god awakens.~
@21546 = ~You already do. You just don't know yet. It will come.~
@21547 = ~Hold your tongue, cur. I do not answer to one such as you.~
@21548 = ~Never! Die monsters! I will kill your evil and find a cure!~
@21549 = ~We are merely looking around.~
@21550 = ~I guess it's not that bad, really. We shall be free to run...~
@21551 = ~We know that the cult resides within and we have come to retrieve the dagger that was stolen from us.~
@21552 = ~But you have infected me with... lycanthropy?! You are utterly evil!~
@21553 = ~I had hoped you would see different. So be it. You not belong, now or ever. Now the village must see as you truly are, an outsider who will harm. I will take your charts from you, as we might have some use for them. Die then, before our gift takes you.~
@21554 = ~Not so. We have a gift as a race, and wish to share with many. You will see, now that you are welcome. You who would help us to leave will belong and be welcome.~
@21555 = ~You must be the one's whose boat broke up on the reefs. Our headwoman, Kaishas Gan, will want to speak with you.~
@21556 = ~Hold your tongue, Tailas. What do you speak of?~
@21557 = ~Brave heroes, eh? Fools more like it.~
@21558 = ~They would be our saviors, Tailas, and you threaten? What sense is this?~
@21559 = ~You would turn our own against those who would save? Fools you are! <CHARNAME>, I absolve you for what you must do. I must take your charts, as I cannot see them damaged in the coming conflict. Defend from what comes. I will decide later what to do about the gift.~
@21560 = ~Silence, cur. Think carefully before you speak to your betters in such a manner.~
@21561 = ~Have we offended you in some way, sir?~
@21562 = ~We claim to be neither heroes nor fools. Explain yourself.~
@21563 = ~Now you are my betters? Go and be destroyed by the evil wolves if you wish. You outsiders bring only trouble, anyway.~
@21564 = ~My apologies. You have not offended me. I only wish to protect my people from the disease of too much hope. Everyone knows that you go to fight the evil wolves. I have fought them often and I know their strengths. I do not think that you can destroy them. Perhaps you are great warriors, as the villagers believe. As they want to believe. If so, I will respect you abilities and wish you luck. Perhaps you only wish to be heroes. If so, I respect your courage but doubt that you will survive the day.~
@21565 = ~I say NAY, Kaishas Gan, and others with me!~
@21566 = ~You are entitled to your opinion. Allow our actions to speak for us. We will not demand your respect until we prove ourselves before you all.~
@21567 = ~These mongrels are NOT welcome! We pure of blood from ages of the change. These cattle not as we! We should kill those that take the bite! They will only dilute our grace!~
@21568 = ~The best sense! I sense their filth, their... their difference! We are pure and should stay so! None will let them live! I have told to the village their hatred, and the things that their kind does to we! Believed me our people have! These mongrels will not leave alive, but we shall! With ship and maps!~
@21569 = ~I'm not interested in your opinion. By all accounts, you people have never left this island since your ancestors were shipwrecked here several centuries ago. You will forgive me if your opinion holds little weight with me. Now run along, toy soldier; I think there are some weeds to battle in the garden.~
@21570 = ~You say that you have fought these beasts. Tell us what you know about them and their weaknesses.~
@21571 = ~You... you do not belong! I smell outsider on you! Get away from me! Go speak with Kaishas. She may deal with the like of you, but I will not!~
@21572 = ~It is my job to protect the people of my clan from all dangers, including your promise of deliverance from the man-wolves. I have fought the beasts. You and your handful of warriors have little chance of defeating these monsters. I don't want you running around making promises that cannot be kept.~
@21573 = ~You are entitled to your opinion. Allow our actions to speak for us. We will not demand your respect until we prove ourselves before you all.~
@21574 = ~I'm not interested in your opinion. By all accounts, you people have never left this island since your ancestors were shipwrecked here several centuries ago. You will forgive me if your opinion holds little weight with me. Now run along, toy soldier; I think there are some weeds to battle in the garden.~
@21575 = ~So you have been given free leash to walk in our village, have you? Well I care not! You will stay away from mine. Others may accept you, but not I. I and others, too.~
@21576 = ~You say that you have fought these beasts. Tell us what you know about them and their weaknesses.~
@21577 = ~May luck be with you, then. You shall need plenty of it.~
@21578 = ~Watch your step in my village or I will kill you.~
@21579 = ~The wolves can appear to be human, but don't be fooled: they are animals at heart. They will kill for pleasure as much as for food. The younger wolf beasts are much weaker than their elders. They are dark brown in color with some black fur. They are completely tactless. They will attack without thought regardless of the odds.~
@21580 = ~Surely the way can be opened for us. Will 200 gp suffice?~
@21581 = ~The older beasts are black with some silver fur. They are powerful and cunning foes. Some of them can even cast spells. They live on the ship of our ancestors. A great black brute rules them. He calls himself Karoug. The beasts cannot be injured with normal weapons. Only blessed or enchanted weapons will harm them. They will always change to their true form to attack. That is all that I can help you with. I hope that you are successful.~
@21582 = ~I thank you for destroying our enemies. We are in your debt.~
@21583 = ~All right, we'll leave. No need to get huffy.~
@21584 = ~If you have brain you'll realize that you are the one who should be leaving. Move aside or die!~
@21585 = ~You tire me, cultist. Draw a blade and fight!~
@21586 = ~You have done what must, but now I stop. Here you hold, and here you must die.~
@21587 = ~Why should we fight? We can still leave on your ship. Give us back the sea charts and we can all go.~
@21588 = ~You will die like the rest of your kind! Monsters all of you!~
@21589 = ~I do not wish to exterminate you all. Just give me the charts and the ship and I can go.~
@21590 = ~Why must we fight? Cannot let you leave knowing all this. We could have existed peacefully, but now you have fought and will never accept. Others will come to kill or capture. Adventurers like you always come, do they not? No, I must fight, and you must die! We may still have hope if Selaad returns, but you cannot help anymore.~
@21591 = ~So it must be. We not leave, but neither will you. None must know of us, not know that we are threat. You will die, even if we must as well! Perhaps Selaad will bring another ship, but for now none will leave.~
@21592 = ~I cannot speak with you at this time. Please leave me to my work.~
@21593 = ~Such generosity, but if you leave you will exterminate anyway. Others will come, other fools just to fight the "evil" we are. No, we must remain alone here now, and so must you. Die and sleep, and you will not know the loneliness. Perhaps if Selaad returns we will try again. Until then, we stay.~
@21594 = ~Strangers! How is it possible? You must speak with Kaishas.~
@21595 = ~Hello, good people. I am Maralee. I have heard that you will fight the wolves in the old ship. Is it true?~
@21596 = ~Aye, we will seek them out and destroy them.~
@21597 = ~I don't know what you're talking about. Leave me alone.~
@21598 = ~It is true. What business is it of yours, wench?~
@21599 = ~Please help me, stranger, I have no one left to turn to.~
@21600 = ~What is it, girl?~
@21601 = ~That's too bad. I'm not a brain-dead paladin to be ordered about by any pretty girl that turns my head.~
@21602 = ~I won't help you either.~
@21603 = ~My baby is alone out there, you heartless outsider.~
@21604 = ~I did not mean to be rude. I am just so worried about my child. I guess that you are not the people to help me.~
@21605 = ~Oh, cruelty! A child's life hangs on your whim.~
@21606 = ~My baby, they have him! You must save him! Oh, please!~
@21607 = ~Explain yourself, girl. What child?~
@21608 = ~I care not. Get out of my sight.~
@21609 = ~Slow down, miss, you have my attention.~
@21610 = ~Stop your sniveling, wench!~
@21611 = ~Show me some gold, and then we'll talk.~
@21612 = ~It has been so hard, not knowing. Two moons ago my husband took my son out hunting with him. They were attacked by those horrible wolf-creatures. They... they killed my husband and took my baby. Kaishas says that they took the baby away to eat him but I know he's still alive.~
@21613 = ~They won't go and look for him and they stop me from leaving the village. You have to help me!~
@21614 = ~I could never turn my back on a child who is in distress. If he is still alive I will find him.~
@21615 = ~Of course I'll help you. What does your child look like and where was he last seen?~
@21616 = ~Obviously your child is dead. It's a waste of time to go and look for him. You should listen to Kaishas.~
@21617 = ~Thank you friends! Please bring him back to me.~
@21618 = ~He's a beautiful little boy with dark hair like his father. He is three moons old and his name is Peladan. They took him from my husband northeast of the village, in the woods.~
@21619 = ~Have no fear, Maralee. No cowardly monsters can keep me from the child!~
@21620 = ~You didn't say that I'd have to leave town. I'm afraid I can't help you. I'm afraid of monsters.~
@21621 = ~Please find Peladan. You are my only hope.~
@21622 = ~My son, my son! I have missed you so much! Thank you, friends. I am forever in your debt.~
@21623 = ~My friendship is yours forever, heroes.~
@21624 = ~Hello, you... you smell funny. You swim in?~
@21625 = ~Begone, child! I have no time for you!~
@21626 = ~Leave me, child! I don't have time to speak with you!~
@21627 = ~Hello, child. You are quite brave to speak with strangers washed-up on the beach. What if we were dangerous?~
@21628 = ~Shouldn't speak with strangers, child. What if we were dangerous?~
@21629 = ~Yes child, I did swim in. Our ship sank and we are in need of shelter.~
@21630 = ~Eww, you act mean. The village won't like you if you act this way. They will not trust you anyway 'cuz you don't belong. Be nicer, okay?~
@21631 = ~Sorry, little one. I am just a bit winded from my long swim. I will be nicer once I dry out.~
@21632 = ~I should speak with you later. I need time to collect my thoughts.~
@21633 = ~I will act how I choose to act. If you don't like it, then move along!~
@21634 = ~Maybe I help you look? No, you were speaking funny like mommay sometimes does. Okay, I wait a moment.~
@21635 = ~You better now? I have to go soon.~
@21636 = ~I would like to speak more with you. How did you come to live here?~
@21637 = ~Then go. I have no further need of you.~
@21638 = ~Fine, I will!~
@21639 = ~No, I think it will be you that moves. This is our home, and you are the one who does not belong. The others will not like you at all. Goodbye.~
@21640 = ~No time? You have all the time. If you swim in then the island-home is yours now too. No way to go, 'cept swimmin' out to the mean old fishies. They gots teeth bigger than my daddy! You'll be staying here now. Maybe even get to belong like us.~
@21641 = ~Belong? Who else is here? You are not alone, are you?~
@21642 = ~What kind of community could exist on this deserted isle? Certainly nothing I would want to "belong" to.~
@21643 = ~Silly, you not dangerous. You are driftwood and all soggy and hurt. You are from outside, but maybe you belong if you are nice.~
@21644 = ~Then I will try to be nice. Who lives here? You are not all by yourself, are you?~
@21645 = ~I am sure there is nothing here I would want to be a part of. I will be leaving as soon as possible.~
@21646 = ~If you get mean then the village won't let you stay. You don't belong, so I'd be nice or you'll have to swim home. Fishies out there have big teeth, and the rocks hurt ship-homes.~
@21647 = ~I certainly don't want to dare the sea again any time soon. What about you? Are you alone here?~
@21648 = ~I am sure I will be leaving soon. I don't want to stay in this deserted hole any longer than I have to.~
@21649 = ~And who is going to send me back amongst the fishies? Move aside!~
@21650 = ~Okay, I believe you. Not see many that swim in. Many float, but don't wake up. Fishies are mean and cliffs hurt ship-homes. You lucky. Still smell funny though. Maybe you stay and belong?~
@21651 = ~Belong to whom, little one? You are not alone here?~
@21652 = ~Maybe I will stay and take over. This place looks pretty deserted and primitive.~
@21653 = ~Perhaps I shall stay, though I doubt you or anyone else could tell me otherwise. Move aside.~
@21654 = ~Alone? Of course not, silly. There's mommay, poppay, my brother too. We've got neighbors too. The village is very nice. It's boring sometimes, but I like it.~
@21655 = ~The seas are treacherous in this area. How did you come to live here? I saw no ships nearby.~
@21656 = ~A lovely story, child, but I must be going now. Perhaps we will meet later?~
@21657 = ~I tire of speaking to you. Leave me be.~
@21658 = ~Mommay says great-great grammay came here on a ship-home like you. Somthin' happened and they had to swim or be caught by the fishies. The ship-home is here somewhere, I guess. We're not allowed to go there.~
@21659 = ~You do not seem alarmed to see me. How often do strangers come here?~
@21660 = ~Very interesting. I must be going now, but perhaps we will meet later?~
@21661 = ~I grow weary of your voice. Move along.~
@21662 = ~Not very often, and they don't always want to make friends. That's what mommay says, but I never seen anyone that doesn't belong. Until I meet you, anyway. You still smell funny, but you not scary. Not like the beasties.~
@21663 = ~The "beasties"? What do you mean?~
@21664 = ~I have enjoyed out chat, but I should make my way inland.~
@21665 = ~I don't care to continue this chat. Move along, will you?~
@21666 = ~The beasties are scary. They sometimes look like us, but they change and get mean. Mommay says they are nothing more than animals, but the other animals don't hate us so much. Maybe... maybe you will help us?~
@21667 = ~Perhaps, but I should meet with your people and find out what is going on first.~
@21668 = ~Perhaps I will, if there is something in it for me.~
@21669 = ~Not likely. I don't risk my neck for strangers.~
@21670 = ~Yeah, you go to the village and speak to mommay's friend, Kaishas. She leads while mister chieftain is away. Dunno where he went, but he's away and you should speak to Kaishas. I gotta go, but maybe we will see each other later, maybe I too busy playing. We'll see. Bye-bye!~
@21671 = ~Maybe mommay could give you something, but you are better to speak with Kaishas. She leads while mister chieftain is away. Don't know where he is, so speak with Kaishas. I gotta go. Bye-bye.~
@21672 = ~You're not very nice, are you? I thought you were, but I was wrong. Kaishas will not like you at all either. You'd better be nicer to her. I'm just a pup, but she rules our home. Goodbye.~
@21673 = ~Heya, you can hide over here!~
@21674 = ~I know they think you are mean, but you were nice to me. We still friends, okay?~
@21675 = ~Yes, little one, I still wish your friendship.~
@21676 = ~I only wish to leave this place! I want nothing from any of you now!~
@21677 = ~You will all die in my wake!~
@21678 = ~Well, good! I knew you weren't so mean. The others get all worked up and distrust everyone, but I know nice when I see it. Just like these flowers I found. They are nice too. Pretty, and smell nice. Want some?~
@21679 = ~Certainly. I would love some. I also need a way out of the village so I don't have to hurt many of your people.~
@21680 = ~I have no time for your flowers. I need to get out of the village without getting hurt. Do you know a way?~
@21681 = ~No, I don't want any of your silly little flowers! Tell me how to get out of here or I will have to kill everyone!~
@21682 = ~Well fine, just you run then, and run fast you'd better! They catch you, they gonna make you hurt!~
@21683 = ~You gonna hurt us all?! You're not nice like I thought. You are a big liar! I hope they hurt you bad!~
@21684 = ~You gotta go? Yeah, I suppose you do. Okay, I tell you how to get out okay and safe. They gonna watch the gate for you, but you go by the east beach and look along the wall. There's a hole that I get out through sometimes. Mommay never knew about it, even though I would bring back flowers for her. You'd better go fast. I try and make them think you went another way, okay? Please try not to hurt many people, they just want to be left alone mostly.~
@21685 = ~I s'pose I do, but you can't tell anyone I told you. They would be mad at me for sure. I get out through the fence along the east beach. Mommay never found out, even though I bring flowers back for her. You go that way and you will be okay, okay? Please try not to hurt too many. Most of the village is happy her by themselves. Don't want to hurt anybody. They don't trust you though. I gotta go, bye-bye.~
@21686 = ~You run by the east beach and get through the wall there. You run, and run fast and maybe you make it. You yell like that again and maybe you won't. Poppay will find you and hurt you, so go now. Goodbye!~
@21687 = ~Heya, silly. You talk to Kaishas yet? She will wanna ask you somethin', I'm sure. Better go before mommay sees me talking with you.~
@21688 = ~You gonna help us all? That's great! I knew you would!~
@21689 = ~You gonna help us? Maybe you not so mean after all. I dunno though. You better be extra nice, and then I see.~
@21690 = ~Well, hello there. You are an... outsider, are you not? I have not met one of your kind before today. Mentioned the world outside once or twice the elders have, but never did they say that creatures of such beauty could exist. You are an alluring presence, and I welcome you.~
@21691 = ~Quite the wolf in sheep's clothing, aren't you? I like a big, strong man that isn't afraid to say what he thinks.~
@21692 = ~Careful what you say, lest you cloud my judgement and I give the local lasses some competition for you. Wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so I'll just let them have you.~
@21693 = ~Stow the sweet talk malarkey before I feed your words back to you on a platter! I don't take kindly to fools like you trying to paw their way into my good books.~
@21694 = ~I am no wolf! I am man first and foremost! The wolf remains among the animals and beasts, and is unworthy of life in our village! You insult me deeply, and I bid you farewell! Leave me!~
@21695 = ~Heh, I understand your answer, and shall leave you to your thoughts. Know that I think well of you, and would paddle across a thousand oceans for but a look at your gracious smile.~
@21696 = ~Well, I see that your beauteous exterior hides a mongrel within. You have not done much to endear me to outsiders. Begone from my sight.~
@21697 = ~It would seem the others were right about outsiders after all. You will not escape this island home, m'lady!~
@21698 = ~Hold! I shall not harm you! You may be outsider, but that is no excuse for others to seek your death. Follow me, for I know a way out of the village less dangerous. There are warrens beneath the chieftain's hut to the northwest. Follow and I will lead.~
@21699 = ~Well now, who've we here? You're a fine looking fellow if ever I've seen one. The elders have mentioned the outside from time to time, but never did they say such stock ran hearty in those far away climes. Have you come to stay, or are you just here to break some hearts and begone? I'm undecided as to which I would prefer. You have an... alluring scent that I am quite unused to.~
@21700 = ~Certainly a young island girl such as you is unused to my continental charms. Shall we forgo introductions and hide ourselves away in the woods? We shall frolic as animals, free from the constraints of society.~
@21701 = ~Your manner is flattering, but I would never be so cruel as to take you away from the lucky men that populate this village. Their pain would be all the greater for having known you so long.~
@21702 = ~Keep your affections to yourself! I have no interest any of you simpletons on this isle!~
@21703 = ~We do not consort as animals here! We are civilized and have locked the beasts outside the wall! If you would act as they then you have no purpose here!~
@21704 = ~My, but you are a charmer, aren't you? Just the right words to turn down a lass with no hard feelings left. So be it, you may be kind to the others and leave me for them. I shall think fondly of you though, and should you change your mind I will be here.~
@21705 = ~I merely wished to extend greetings, but obviously outsiders are exactly as they say. You are nothing but an uncultured lout! Get away from me!~
@21706 = ~You again? You are exactly the kind of trouble the elders said you would be! Outsiders that should be expelled from our village!~
@21707 = ~I... I know the others would have you dead, but I'll not raise a claw in your direction. You are just as deserving of life as any other, and I would fight by your side as long as I am able. Follow me, for I know a way out of the village less dangerous. There are warrens beneath the chieftain's hut. Follow and I will lead. That my former friends would attack you shows that they are not who I thought they were, and I feel no shame helping you.~
@21708 = ~Step right up folks and HEAR the tale of dread placed before thee. Join with me as I, adventurer extraordinaire Ike Cascadion Vendar, lead yet another group of brave souls through the very SEAT of danger in the Realms. To Durlag's Tower we shall go, and witness the perils that have taken the lives of hundreds of courageous men and women. SEE the horror of the treacherous traps; FEEL the presence of the long languishing dead; MARVEL at the wondrous wealth buried below! NOT for the weak of spirit as I will NOT be held accountable for any heart failure during OR after our expedition! Step up, step up! One at a TIME!~
@21709 = ~Ahh, good people of noble blood who would throw down the gauntlet in the face of chance! Come see the lengths a man must go to protect what's his. A special package deal of 60 gold for your entire group, not that you would need a discount.~
@21710 = ~Hello to you my friends! Come see the lengths the wealthy must go, just to protect their fortunes. 'Tis a life I'd wish on no-one. Just 80 gold for your entire group, and I don't do this for everyone.~
@21711 = ~All right, step up you louts! 100 gold for the lot of ye, but you stand in the back! And if I catch you pinching a single purse I'll have you run through. 'Tis a dangerous place to which we go, and I've "lost" people before.~
@21712 = ~I have no other price, so take it or leave it.~
@21713 = ~Is it your purse, or yer nerve that's lacking? Well I'll be here daily if ye fill either. Shoo, I've paying customers.~
@21714 = ~Yes, the tower scares away the best of us. I'll be leaving here daily, if you find your spine.~
@21715 = ~You have a deal sir! When are we to leave?~
@21716 = ~'Tis too much gold for my purse.~
@21717 = ~I'm not interested in your "adventuring" tours, huckster.~
@21718 = ~You have a deal sir! When are we to leave?~
@21719 = ~You have a deal sir! When are we to leave?~
@21720 = ~'Tis too much gold for my purse.~
@21721 = ~'Tis too much gold for my purse.~
@21722 = ~I'm not interested in your "adventuring" tours, huckster.~
@21723 = ~I'm not interested in your "adventuring" tours, huckster.~
@21724 = ~You have a deal, sir! When are we to leave?~
@21725 = ~I'm not interested in your "adventuring" tours, huckster.~
@21726 = ~Fine, ye unreasonable skinflint! Keep yer blasted tour!~
@21727 = ~That will fill my quota for this trip. We leave forthwith! Remember to kiss your loved ones good-by, for you may never... see them... AGAIN! Meet me at the base of the tower! You would surely be KILLED without me, but fear not! Only I can enter where others FEAR to TREAD!~
@21728 = ~You have a deal sir! When are we to leave?~
@21729 = ~You have a deal sir! When are we to leave?~
@21730 = ~'Tis about time you got here! I'll wait no longer! The others are already inside! If you don't follow me now, you forfeit your deposit! The tour will not be delayed for you! Now, let us get on with it.~
@21731 = ~See how she looms before us as we draw near. Never before and never again will the like be seen. A monument to one man's triumph... and his FOLLY!~
@21732 = ~The tower, and labyrinth below, were built ages ago by the dwarven hero Durlag "Thunderaxe," for no less worthy a purpose than to be a home for him and his kin. His enormous fortune occupied ENTIRE rooms, rumored WAIST-DEEP on a man. The wealth he had accumulated was to be the BACKBONE of his clan, but it was ultimately their DOWNFALL.~
@21733 = ~The stories of his opulence spread across the land, and the most unsavory of creatures sought to make the tower theirs. All of Durlag's kin and friends were replaced by DOPPELGANGERS, and he found himself KILLING the visage of those that he CARED most, just to SAVE HIMSELF. Who among YOU could bear THAT?! In the end he DROVE them from his now sullen home, and vowed that NONE would dare the same again!~
@21734 = ~Durlag installed magical locks on the entrances to his inner sanctum, requiring ward tokens to pass. No doubt you have ALL been approached by unscrupulous merchants selling "genuine" tokens to the tower. Indeed, I MYSELF have SEVERAL, but they are mere souvenirs for the mantle. There are but a few AUTHENTIC tokens, and they are rare and EXPENSIVE.~
@21735 = ~Those that passed the wards were confronted with the fruits of the paranoia that CONSUMED Durlag. In this sitting room alone are some of the most fiendish DEVICES OF DEATH known to man! Upon the wall was a picture that, before it was RIPPED from its frame, caused those that looked upon it to freeze in their tracks for ALL TIME! Look with HORROR upon this hapless soul!~
@21736 = ~This chair, once sat in, would deliver an UNHOLY spike to your nether regions. IMAGINE the EXCRUCIATING SURPRISE of the UNWARY! Durlag went to lengths heretofore UNKNOWN to keep out intruders!~
@21737 = ~We'll take a small break here before moving on, good people. Please, for your own safety, TOUCH NOTHING!~
@21738 = ~TOUCH NOTHING and NO REFUNDS!~
@21739 = ~Be VERY careful about this tower, otherwise you'll end up burnt alive like the other unfortunate tourist. I would speak with you a moment, because there's something different about you. I can tell you're not buying the hyped-up crap I feed to most people. You've got a look in your eyes that says "I don't believe in danger, I don't know what fear means, and I will go where no sane person ever would!" I think you're just what I need. I have one of the true tokens to the dungeons below, but I am not half the fool I once was. 'Tis yours for a measly 300 gold, on the condition that if you do not succeed, you return it to me.~
@21740 = ~'Tis more than fair. I'll take it sir, and give those dungeons a what-for!~
@21741 = ~Why only 300 gold if it is the real thing? You said yourself that the genuine ones are very expensive.~
@21742 = ~I do not believe you. 'Tis but a cheap fake, not unlike yourself!~
@21743 = ~I'll not be risking my neck in those dungeons! 'Tis madness at any price!~
@21744 = ~'Tis good news for both of us! I'm not sure how far the token allows access, but it should be at least as far as the third floor down. Good luck eh, and remember our deal. You'd best go get stocked up, while I get back to my job. What... in the name of the gods is THAT?!?!?!~
@21745 = ~Blast and damnation! Touch nothing, I says, but do they ever listen? No sir! All of 'em think they know better than old Ike. And they wonder why I demand payment up front! Back to town for another load I guess.~
@21746 = ~'Tis a win/win deal for me. If you actually manage to defeat a few rooms, you get the gold and I get a new tour attraction. If you're defeated, I get the token back, or at the very least I have your body as a new display. I can't lose. Deal?~
@21747 = ~'Tis true I've sold many a fake in my time, but not today. I know this one is real because I've opened the door myself, but I need an adventurer's muscle and skill. If not yours then someone else's.~
@21748 = ~Well I definitely read you wrong! Back to the other gawkers with ya! You can diddle about the tower with the rest of the tour. Now if you'll excuse me... by the gods... what is THAT?!?!?!~
@21749 = ~Have you're changed your mind about the token, or are you still the sensible coward?~
@21750 = ~I have reconsidered your offer. I'll take your token, and those dungeons, for all they're worth!~
@21751 = ~Perhaps if you reduced the price I might reconsider.~
@21752 = ~Bah! My answer is still no!~
@21753 = ~I new ye had it in ye! Good luck and fortune to us both! The token should allow access to the second level down at the very least, and that's more than has been seen by living eyes in over a hundred years! I can hardly wait to tour it! Nobles will come from leagues distant! Remember our deal; any treasure be yours, but just make sure ye clear more than a room or two. On your way!~
@21754 = ~If that be your choice, so be it. There are plenty of brave, adventure seeking youths I can hire. Plenty! I just... have to keep looking is all. Waste no more of my time.~
@21755 = ~The price be cheaper than most fakes! You insult me! Leave me to my paying customers!~
@21756 = ~You win no matter what happens to me! I won't be your expendable stooge! Forget it!~
@21757 = ~Let it be someone else then! I'll not kill myself going where ye be afraid to go yourself.~
@21758 = ~'Tis more than fair. I'll take it sir, and give those dungeons a what-for!~
@21759 = ~I do not believe you. 'Tis but a cheap fake, not unlike yourself!~
@21760 = ~I'll not be risking my neck in those dungeons! 'Tis madness at any price!~
@21761 = ~'Tis more than fair. I'll take it sir, and give those dungeons a what-for!~
@21762 = ~Why only 300 gold if it is the real thing? You said yourself that the genuine ones are very expensive.~
@21763 = ~I'll not be risking my neck in those dungeons! 'Tis madness at any price!~
@21764 = ~Well if your trinket be what you say, why don't you go down?~
@21765 = ~Yer a fool, Galken.~
@21766 = ~Will no-one take me offer? Bah! Yer all nay men at all!~
@21767 = ~Uh... 'tis a problem with me legs. The gout be in me left leg somethin' fierce, and... (whispers) and I gotta pay off the Innkeep lest he take me right. I've not the card-luck I once had.~
@21768 = ~You look a touch out of place here, you do. A person of the most particular tastes, eh? Slumming here because you like the finer things, but you want excitement and a bit o' danger as well? Well I've just the thing, if you're willing. Have I piqued yer interest?~
@21769 = ~Hey... how'd you like to be supping on fine venison and tippin' back the good stuff? I've the key to wealth legendary if you're up for it. Hear me out and the rest of these sods will be tuggin' on your coat-tails for loose coppers some day.~
@21770 = ~'Ere friend. How'd ya like a ticket out o' the alleys? I've the key to a great batch o' swag if you're interested, or are ya too busy cuttin' purse-strings tonight?~
@21771 = ~Bah! Cowards all! Still, I'll be here beggin' for more time if you change you're mind.~
@21772 = ~Have ye changed yer mind, or am I to be washin' dishes 'til kingdom come?~
@21773 = ~I will hear you out. Speak your offer.~
@21774 = ~My answer is the same.~
@21775 = ~Ah, you've an adventurer's spirit in ye. No doubt you've heard of the labyrinth at Durlag's Tower, eh? And how she's been pillaged so often that fat nobles go there for picnics? Well the TOWER has, but BELOW are dungeons untouched! I've a token, a ward token to be sure, that gives entry to them. 'Tis yours if you'll but settle my tab so I can leave this fine place... with all my limbs intact.~
@21776 = ~You have a deal, sir!~
@21777 = ~How much of a tab is the stake?~
@21778 = ~Where did the likes of you get this?~
@21779 = ~I knew there was a catch! Get lost, roustabout!~
@21780 = ~Like all things it had an owner before me who does not have it now. 'Tis none of your affair what occurred in between. Shall you own it next, or no?~
@21781 = ~Tell me more, good sir.~
@21782 = ~Off with you and your trinkets.~
@21783 = ~Tell me more, good sir.~
@21784 = ~Off with you and your trinkets.~
@21785 = ~Tell me more, good sir.~
@21786 = ~Off with you and your trinkets.~
@21787 = ~I'll have no part in your stolen goods!~
@21788 = ~Oh, 'tis but a meager sum. I'm embarrassed I cannot cover it myself. 900 gold and I'm off the hook. What say, chum?~
@21789 = ~'Tis hardly a small amount! I won't pay it!~
@21790 = ~Ahh bless your kindness! I'm off to pay my bill before I suffer any more interest, of either sort, from the Inn-keep.~
@21791 = ~Oh, by the by; while I am quite certain he could not find me here, the former owner of that little trinket may well be keeping an eye over Durlag way, to see if he can spot someone using it. Just thought I'd pass along the warning since ye did me this favor. I'm sure he'll listen to reason, though.~
@21792 = ~You have a deal sir!~
@21793 = ~How much of a tab is the stake?~
@21794 = ~You have a deal sir!~
@21795 = ~Where did the likes of you get this?~
@21796 = ~Blast it thrice over! I am through with it I am so! 'Tis no livin' left here none!~
@21797 = ~Likely not but can I help you? Please be quick as I close forever tonight I do.~
@21798 = ~What do you want I ask you say quick now! I close soon and not open for customers who not come!~
@21799 = ~Yeah, you all nice nice now but no gold right? 'Tis same all day every day night too sometimes! Nice nice people come look and look and say nice nice and leave! I lose patience for the nice to look at pretty to hold but don't buy a suffering thing! You here to buy or you just say nice and leave?~
@21800 = ~Good Merchant, what is your worry? You seem troubled.~
@21801 = ~I'll not suffer this treatment! I'll take my business elsewhere!~
@21802 = ~No need to be rude about it. Do you want my business or not?!~
@21803 = ~Good Merchant, what is your worry? You seem troubled.~
@21804 = ~I'll not suffer this treatment! I'll take my business elsewhere!~
@21805 = ~No need to be rude about it. Do you want my business or not?!~
@21806 = ~I might be interested. Tell me, what exactly do you deal in?~
@21807 = ~Why are you closing up? Surely it's not because of your happy demeanor.~
@21808 = ~I've had it with you, you insolent weasel! Good-bye and good riddance!~
@21809 = ~Do I want YOUR business do I!? I don't even want MY business no more I don't! Maybe I go farm or fish or maybe I just go lie under a rock somewhere! You here to buy or just make pretty patterns in my dusty floor? Shuffle to the left to the spot you missed you did.~
@21810 = ~Yeah, go ahead you go! You and everyone else not here and gone! I don't need you anyway not at all! I can run this store without customers I can and have! Buy something or get out so I can move somewhere where too-talls don't just talk they got gold!~
@21811 = ~That damn and blasted Ike gets all the high-class money throwers with his society kissy-kissy they're suckers for. I can do that too, but it makes me sick it does, so buy or get out!~
@21812 = ~Oh I miss you already 'cause your riddance weren't half as good as you say! Begone and get out and go hence and wherever!~
@21813 = ~I sell the small and shinies for the tourists in the Durlag's Tower but there are none now there! Bandits on the roads keep the people off and away so I'm stuck with all this stock I am. Ward tokens I have of all shapes and size. Some I found by elven ruin and some I made myself I made. Maybe some good or maybe all bad but don't they all look pretty? I tell you what I will. I'll sell you everything I have you buy for low low price of 500 gold is all. Then I go home where they appreciate a bauble shine. Buy or no and walk the walk?~
@21814 = ~You have a deal and done! Oh hell, now I'm doing it.~
@21815 = ~'Tis too expensive at that price. Go a little lower and I may consider it.~
@21816 = ~I have no need for you trinkets. Good-by.~
@21817 = ~Lower!? 'Tis my whole stock it is and lower you want!? Let me just check a few signs I will. No the stars have not turned to fireflies, pigs do not fly, and the lower planes hath not frozen over so it's NOT GONNA HAPPEN! When last I checked I did not have "FOOL" tattooed across my forehead, I do not! Get out and hence!~
@21818 = ~Good and Done! Now take it all and get out so I can pack and go. 'Tis enough of my time in this place gone and lost from me.~
@21819 = ~That's the trouble with the youth of today and now. They have no appreciation for the finer bitty baubley things in life at all they don't. Go and begone and you'll all be sorry 'cause I'm closing. Get and go!~
@21820 = ~What are you here for again you're back! Get out and go so I can finish packing up and out!~
@21821 = ~This stuff takes too long to pack less time to throw out. Why are you back and here again? Buy the store or get out and gone!~
@21822 = ~Out you get out! I am closed for all-time permanent I am!~
@21823 = ~Fine, I shall take everything for 500 gold.~
@21824 = ~Never mind, I am out and gone.~
@21825 = ~I might be interested. Tell me, what exactly do you deal in?~
@21826 = ~Why are you closing up? Surely it's not because of your happy demeanor.~
@21827 = ~I've had it with you, you insolent weasel! Good-bye and good riddance!~
@21828 = ~I might be interested. Tell me, what exactly do you deal in?~
@21829 = ~I might be interested. Tell me, what exactly do you deal in?~
@21830 = ~Why are you closing up? Surely it's not because of your happy demeanor.~
@21831 = ~I've had it with you, you insolent weasel! Good-bye and good riddance!~
@21832 = ~I've had it with you, you insolent weasel! Good-bye and good riddance!~
@21833 = ~Oh, please help me! They kill poor Jondal.~
@21834 = ~New actors in our little drama. Who might you be? Shipwrecked sailors, perhaps?~
@21835 = ~What business is it of yours?~
@21836 = ~The wolf-men. They attack us as we search for roots in the forest. Please avenge my Jondal. He was so young...~
@21837 = ~Feeling somewhat cryptic today, are you?~
@21838 = ~We are the party of <CHARNAME>. We have come to retrieve artifacts from Balduran's ship.~
@21839 = ~They are this way. Please kill them, I am so frightened.~
@21840 = ~Leave me be, good man. I have no time to speak with you at present.~
@21841 = ~Save your impatience, outsider. There is nothing but time on our island paradise.~
@21842 = ~You terrible people!~
@21843 = ~I apologize. We are merely in a rush to start our excursion. If you will excuse us...~
@21844 = ~Are you not familiar with the goings-on in your own village? If a boat is being built then there is a good chance that the clan may escape the island.~
@21845 = ~My time is my business. Move before I hurt you.~
@21846 = ~Somewhat. You are certainly braver than the cattle inside. You leave the safety of the palisade with a confident stride and a dangerous look about you. Those fools within are frightened of their own shadows.~
@21847 = ~Somewhat... you are certainly braver than the cattle inside the village. You leave the safety of the palisade with a confident stride and a dangerous look about you. Those fools within are frightened of their own shadows.~
@21848 = ~Jondal! I have brought you a feast.~
@21849 = ~What of you? Here you stand, alone and open to attack.~
@21850 = ~What I do and when I do it is no concern of yours. Stand aside immediately.~
@21851 = ~Are you not aware of the danger that lies within the bowels of that ship?~
@21852 = ~The tales of superstitious villagers do not frighten me. Enough of this, we must be off.~
@21853 = ~We will rid the ship of its vermin even as we retrieve that which we seek.~
@21854 = ~I have been made aware of the lycanthropes that infest the ship. If they get in my way then they will taste my steel.~
@21855 = ~Who killed Jondal?~
@21856 = ~As you will. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@21857 = ~If this Jondal is dead, then he was weak and should never have been born.~
@21858 = ~The fools within the village walls believe anything that they are told. Kaishas is powerless to leave until Selaad returns. Unless, of course, he sent you here.~
@21859 = ~I will help you, fair maiden. Show me where this attack took place.~
@21860 = ~I have never made this Selaad's acquaintance. We came at the request of an archaeologist. Why don't you go and speak with your headwoman. I haven't the time or the inclination to explain it to you.~
@21861 = ~Kaishas doesn't seem to agree with you. She seems confident of her ability to sail the clan to the mainland.~
@21862 = ~Enough innuendo. If you have something to say, then say it.~
@21863 = ~Young and stupid, by the sound of it. Get back to the village, girl, and I hope you learned your lesson.~
@21864 = ~You cannot order me about, outsider. You and the fools inside are nothing more than meat to me. My kind will destroy Kaishas and her petty clan. You will be a fair beginning.~
@21865 = ~And vengeance you shall get, my lady. Lead on!~
@21866 = ~I'm to busy too indulge a little girl's fantasy. Get ye gone!~
@21867 = ~I am not without my defenses, brash one. What does Kaishas ask of you?~
@21868 = ~She asks that we destroy the wolf beasts in their lair.~
@21869 = ~Good day to you, strangers. Excuse my, uhm, abruptness but I would ask your assistance. Just east of this place there are monsters. They are attacking a small group of people. Please, if you have hearts, come and help me fight.~
@21870 = ~It is none of your concern. Leave us be or face our wrath.~
@21871 = ~Why don't you go and speak with Kaishas? I haven't the time.~
@21872 = ~Karoug will have something to say about that, no doubt. Now that you are Kaishas' lackey, what do you get out of it?~
@21873 = ~This way, this way!~
@21874 = ~I am no one's lackey, dog. Draw steel if you cannot understand that.~
@21875 = ~As you will. Come, my brothers; let us feast.~
@21876 = ~We will gain escape from the island. The boat that we arrived on was shipwrecked on the reefs.~
@21877 = ~Take your foolish questions to Kaishas. I haven't the time.~
@21878 = ~Of course. Whatever you wish.~

@21889 = ~So I shall. You are very much beyond your abilities here, friend. Kaishas will use you, then kill you. Karoug will most likely just kill you. Though perhaps I'll settle the matter right here and now.~
@21890 = ~Lead the way. Let us show these beasts the face of fear.~

@21912 = ~Neither monsters nor this "Kaishas" will keep us from our goal. Run along now, girl; we don't need your help.~
@21913 = ~With or without permission, we will find the items that we seek. Take us to the leader of the village.~
@21914 = ~I guess he didn't send you. You had better speak with Kaishas, our headwoman. I will lead you there.~
@21915 = ~You are to take us to the land of our ancestors, of course. Kaishas will be very excited to get news of her mate.~
@21916 = ~Perhaps we each speak of a different person. Kaishas will be able to explain it better than I.~
@21917 = ~You have lied to me. Selaad did not send you at all. You had best follow me to the headwoman's quarters immediately.~
@21918 = ~This is the headwoman's quarters. You may enter when ready.~
@21919 = ~If that is your wish, outsider.~
@21920 = ~I can lead you to the headwoman's quarters if you wish.~

@21957 = ~Bala's Axe: "Wizard Slayer"
Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe gives the owner the ability to dispel magic once a day.

STATISTICS:

This amulet confers the wearer protection against all charm, confusion, fear, domination, know alignment, hold, stun, sleep and feeblemind, much like the 5th level priest spell Chaotic Commands. However the protection effect uses one charge each time it is used and will only last for 1 turn.

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
When this spell is cast the wizard can effect the emotional state of those around him. The effect of this is to inflict a feeling of hopelessness upon the enemies within the visual sight of the caster. Upon a failed save vs. spell, the effected can be seen to lay down where they stand and appear to give over all will to a higher power. Sometimes they can be heard to exclaim things such as "I lay down and die," or "I'm going home." This will last for the duration of the spell upon which they will return to normal.

The secondary effect of this spell is to instill upon the caster the feeling of courage. This will remove any effects of panic and restore his moral, as well as preventing the above from creeping forth into his psyche. There is no save vs. this effect and it will last for the duration of the spell. It will, however, be affected by magic resistance and other such things.~
@22175 = ~It is a keepsake, a symbol of old times. It came from the shiphome and is about all we have left. Kept for a sense of history, so we do not forget. You would do us well to return it. I can offer little other than gratitude, though.~

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: target creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature, if it fails to successfully save vs. spell. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage, actually, the only method of removing the sphere is a dispel magic. Hence the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world.~
@22181 = ~Remove Curse (Abjuration)
Level: 4

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special
Upon casting this spell, the wizard is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more.~
@22182 = ~So be it, but you have no friend made here. Do you not need allies? You may in the future, and will regret for certain. Goodbye.~

Level: 4
Range: line of sight of caster

Saving Throw: Negates Effect
The Polymorph other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a save vs. petrification/polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until a dispel magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~

Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. The caster also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. This spell does not give the new form's other abilities such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

When the spell is cast, for the duration of the spell the caster may transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as he wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offer are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and blunt weapons possessed by the slime.~

@22347 = ~You wish to listen while I speak? There are few of the village that take an interest in history, and I delight in the telling. None are very clear, I fear.

@22369 = ~I am grateful beyond measuring, but I sad as well that I have nothing to give. Perhaps there is something else you wish that I can help?~
@22370 = ~Perhaps just a few questions, m'lady? Some history of you and yours?~
@22371 = ~You have nothing I want, we have determined this already. Take your cloak and leave me.~
@22372 = ~A tale or two, perhaps? Or just pleasant chatter for a time? Tell me of yourself.~
@22373 = ~I have heard enough of your people. They offer no surprises for me, just a simple island folk. Bah! I waste my time here.~
@22374 = ~Young, but not without their charm, just as you are. What of your role? Are you valued here? Have you thought of leaving?~
@22375 = ~You are young as well, and easy to look at. Have you ever thought of leaving this place? Perhaps with an exotic stranger?~
@22376 = ~Your interest is charming, to say least. No, I am not frightened here. We are not weak, just few in number. Our pack is strong within, and the wall keeps those away that would harm. I am happy, though there is much out there, yes? Perhaps I will see, someday.~
@22377 = ~Well hello to ye. I hear much of you around the village. We have not seen your like, not even my eldest of family. Might I ask name?~
@22378 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>, m'lord. What might yours be?~
@22379 = ~My name is mine to know. What is it you want?~
@22380 = ~My name? <CHARNAME>. What of it?~
@22381 = ~I am <CHARNAME>, and I am in a hurry. Speak you mind and move aside.~
@22382 = ~You need not honor with formality, "m'lady." I am Durlyle, and I am pleasured to meet ye.~
@22383 = ~I am sure you are. So what is there to do in this no-horse town?~
@22384 = ~I am sure you are. So what is there to do in this no-horse town? Speak your mind.~
@22385 = ~The pleasure is mine, I am sure. What do you do here?~
@22386 = ~Yes yes, now leave me be. I have no time for idle chatter.~
@22387 = ~Who you? You do not belong... you are none like I have seen. To Kaishas you must go. She leads and you must ask her will to stay. Others may attack if you do not speak to she. Do... do come back when you have. I wish to speak.~
@22388 = ~Straight to the matter and no other. I will not waste your time with pleasantries, and I don't think you grant any in return. If you are as fierce as you are rude then I have need of you. I seek the return of an item, more an icon. No doubt you felt the storm that flew by and by? Village-home did as well, and the cloak that draped the village center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the beasts to get it. Will you?~
@22389 = ~A simple cloak? Why should I risk my neck for such a thing?~
@22390 = ~A prominent and odd place for a cloak. Of what significance is it?~
@22391 = ~I will do as you ask, but I will require an ample reward. What is this item worth?~
@22392 = ~You are quite gruff, quick to the point and no time to falter? I find it refreshing. Others in the village are sickly sweet, and sometimes their company is a chore. You and your scent are so obviously different. Proper introduction then. I am Durlyle, and I am glad to be meeting.~
@22393 = ~Greetings to you, Durlyle. I am thoroughly pleased to meet you. What do you require of me?~
@22394 = ~I say again, what of it? State your mind and leave me to be.~
@22395 = ~What is it you do here?~
@22396 = ~Speak my mind? As you wish. I find you rude and arrogant. You are as I imagined an outsider to be, and I shall be glad when you go. for now however, I might have need of ye. Interested?~
@22397 = ~Sod off. I have no time to run errands.~
@22398 = ~If I must be here, I may as well fill my time. What do you want?~
@22399 = ~Well then, I will leave you to whatever it is an outsider does. Make your stay a brief one.~
@22400 = ~What do I do? I am history. Forgive me, I mean I am historian. I keep the stories of the great elders, and some of the few relics of old. I learn the old tongue well, yes? I try to keep the speech, but we have been our own for some time. What of you? What do you do?~
@22401 = ~I seek adventure and travel.~
@22402 = ~I bring righteousness and order where e'er I go.~
@22403 = ~I am a beachcomber of sorts. I salvage shipwrecks.~
@22404 = ~None of your business, lout.~
@22405 = ~A little of this, a little of that. Whatever opportunity presents itself.~
@22406 = ~Simple to you perhaps, but to we it is important of symbol. From the shiphome it came, and it is of the oldest we could salvage. It was used to drape the roof, as we use the past to move ahead. Little sense, I suppose, but symbols are important. Why should you risk yourself? Because I have asked you too. I can offer little besides my gratitude.~
@22407 = ~Save your gratitude, I have no use for it. I have no time for this, so leave me be.~
@22408 = ~Then I will find it for you, and return it as soon as I can.~
@22409 = ~I will do this, but you will owe me.~
@22410 = ~From the shiphome it came, and is of the few things we have kept. A symbol of the past and how far we've come. You must know how important symbols are to a people, especially one isolated as we. Will you help in this? I can offer only my gratitude.~
@22411 = ~I am not interested in being your errand boy. Leave me alone.~
@22412 = ~I will do as you ask.~
@22413 = ~Then you will owe me a debt in the future. I will get your lost cloak.~
@22414 = ~It is a keepsake, a symbol of old times. It came from the shiphome and is about all we have left. Kept for a sense of history, so we do not forget. You would do us well to return it. I can offer little other than gratitude, though.~
@22415 = ~I have better things to do. Leave me alone.~
@22416 = ~I will help as best I can.~
@22417 = ~You may not be able to pay now, but you will owe me.~
@22418 = ~So be it, but you have no friend made here. Do you not need allies? You may in the future, and will regret for certain. Goodbye.~
@22419 = ~Thanks be. I will await you with hopeful heart. You are a welcome sight to my eyes if you succeed. I wish you well.~
@22420 = ~I will await your return. Please be hurrying in this matter.~
@22421 = ~I have heard of such, of the wandering that knows no bounds. You seek adventure? There is little of such on the island-home. I have but a mundane task to ask of you, if you hear me out?~
@22422 = ~I will listen. What do you need of me?~
@22423 = ~I have little time for your petty errands. Speak quickly!~
@22424 = ~I have no desire to help you, there are more important things I must be doing.~
@22425 = ~A lofty goal, though there is little here for you to cleanse. We have evil and good like any other, but the real devils are outside, as you have listened from Kaishas. That is why I speak with you. I have need for a task. Will you hear me?~
@22426 = ~Certainly. What is it you require?~
@22427 = ~If I must. Speak up and be quick about it.~
@22428 = ~I have wasted too much time on you already. Goodbye.~
@22429 = ~An honest living, though off other misfortune. I have a task similar, though beneath you I hope it isn't. Will you hear me out?~
@22430 = ~Speak your task, and I will help however I can.~
@22431 = ~Be quick about it. I have very little time for your petty concerns.~
@22432 = ~I have wasted too much time already. Goodbye.~
@22433 = ~Whatever blows your way and such? Then I have an appropriate task, if you will hear my words.~
@22434 = ~I will listen. What do you need?~
@22435 = ~Speak quickly, I have wasted enough time now.~
@22436 = ~I grow weary of this idle banter. Goodbye.~
@22437 = ~It is a simple task, complicated some. The storm you felt that took your ship? It was fierce here too, and a cloak that draped the village center was cast to the wind. I think it is beyond the wall, and will not risk the beasts to get it. Will you?~
@22438 = ~A very prominent, though slightly odd place for a cloak. Of what significance is it?~
@22439 = ~Why should I bother to risk my neck for a simple cloak? Is it... valuable?~
@22440 = ~Bah! I am no errand girl!~
@22441 = ~It is from old, as old as we as people. From the ship-home that crumbled beneath, and it symbols the past we have come from. It drapes the village center as we use the past to move forward. You know how important symbols be? This is ours. The beast may have, and I need you to get. Will you help in this?~
@22442 = ~Without question I will help you. I will search and return as quickly as I can.~
@22443 = ~And what shall be my reward for this task? Honest pay for honest work.~
@22444 = ~What do I get out of this? I will require ample reward.~
@22445 = ~I will do what I can for ye.~
@22446 = ~I am not in the mood to fetch your lost toys. Find it yourself.~
@22447 = ~I have little to give, save the warmth of mine heart. You are welcome in my sight, and are a refreshing ear to my tales. If such is ample payment enough, please do as I ask.~
@22448 = ~More than enough, m'lord. More than enough. I will return quickly.~
@22449 = ~Hardly. If there is no pay, I will not help. What can you offer?~
@22450 = ~If you find no value in my gratitude then I have little that will tempt you. I can but ask. Will you help?~
@22451 = ~Aye, that I will.~
@22452 = ~Nay, I don't have the time for charity work.~
@22453 = ~Please return the cloak to us. I will be very grateful of your kindness. You look a kind woman.~
@22454 = ~Please return the cloak to me. You have agreed, and I await your returning.~
@22455 = ~Welcome return. You have the item? It has been missed by we that think of past things.~
@22456 = ~Aye, here is your ragged cloak. Drape it where e're ye wish.~
@22457 = ~I have it, but I still wish to be paid for my trouble.~
@22458 = ~I thank. You will be thought of well, though I still unlike your manner. You have my gratitude despite. Farewell.~
@22459 = ~I have nothing to give such as you. What would you want? The cloak is nothing but value to us, and nothing to you.~
@22460 = ~Ahh, take your raggedy cloak. I have no use for it.~
@22461 = ~Then you will not have it. Perhaps I will use it to polish my boots. Perhaps I will return it to the "beasts."~
@22462 = ~Do not make me ask impolite. I patient to fault, but I cannot bear all. Here, take all that I consider valuable. A coin or two is all I might spare. There is no more to give.~
@22463 = ~That will do nicely. It's the principle of the thing; I never work for free.~
@22464 = ~Ahh, forget it. Take your blasted rag and leave me be.~
@22465 = ~Information would be nice. How did you come to this place? Where were you from before?~
@22466 = ~Pardon if I do not thank fully. Leave me now. I do not wish your sight.~
@22467 = ~I would have told the stories if you wished. We came from farther west than the light rises. The explorer chartered with us and we set to the seas. The elders speak of the great storm, though some say the storm came from within. We that belong were to be cast aside, and fought the explorers we did. Much was lost, but this island won. We live alone and are plagued by the beasts, but slaves to none and live as free.~
@22468 = ~What do you mean when you say "you belong"?~
@22469 = ~What happened to Balduran? It is his ship that supposedly wrecked here.~
@22470 = ~What happened on the ship that caused the wreck?~
@22471 = ~We belong. There is little more to it. if you were to stay, you would have to belong as well. We are a people that lives here as one. You are an outsider, as are the beasts. They are more obvious, but I think you are alike some ways. We have evil among our number alike, but we are respecting.~
@22472 = ~What happened to Balduran? It is his ship that supposedly wrecked here.~
@22473 = ~What happened on the ship that caused the wreck?~
@22474 = ~I tire of tales. Take your ragged cloak and be gone.~
@22475 = ~Balduran?! The explorer who shipped and collected, who would rather scuttle than free. The elders did not see his fate. None wished or cared. He can live among the beast for all that we care. We are better than they and he.~
@22476 = ~What do you mean when you say "you belong"?~
@22477 = ~What happened on the ship that caused the wreck?~
@22478 = ~I tire of tales. Take your ragged cloak and be gone.~
@22479 = ~None are alive to tell. Ages have gone and the dead lay asleep. Tales are of no real truth, only symbols. We were bound, then we freed. Other's fought, but we live to grow. Beyond that is future, and none know that.~
@22480 = ~What happened to Balduran? It is his ship that supposedly wrecked here.~
@22481 = ~What do you mean when you say "you belong"?~
@22482 = ~I tire of tales. Take your ragged cloak and be gone.~
@22483 = ~Ahh, you have returned and look hopeful. I trust in you. Have you the cloak as I asked?~
@22484 = ~I do, Durlyle. It is frail and old, but seems none the worse for wear.~
@22485 = ~I do, but I wonder what I should request in return? Perhaps a few questions you might answer?~
@22486 = ~I have it, but I still wish to be paid for my efforts.~
@22487 = ~You wish to listen while I speak? There are few of the village that take an interest in history, and I delight in the telling. None are very clear, I fear. We were not concerned with records when first we came. They are... embellished, though with good intent, I am sure. You are welcome to stand a while by me... if you wish, good woman.~
@22488 = ~Nothing would please me greater. Tell me of yourself.~
@22489 = ~Yes, yes, whatever. I merely wish to know how you came to be here. Speak up and make it quick.~
@22490 = ~None of this "good woman" business. I am <CHARNAME>. Speak of yourself.~
@22491 = ~Myself?! I am flattered, but there is little to say. My great-grandmother came to the shore on the ship-home, but lived not long. I was born not a leap to the south of here, long after the beasts were cast out, and here I live. We kept the stories, but I say they were tainted by bad memory and superstition. We are all pups in the larger sight. Our people are young...~
@22492 = ~Ahh, but I asked about "you," and you have changed the subject. Are you happy here? Do the dangers not frighten you?~
@22493 = ~I have heard enough of your people. They offer no surprises for me, just a simple island folk. Bah! I waste my time here.~
@22494 = ~Young, but not without their charm, just as you are. What of your role, are you valued here? Have you thought of leaving?~
@22495 = ~You are young as well, and easy to look at. Have you ever thought of leaving this place?~
@22496 = ~I am grateful beyond measuring, but I sad as well that I have nothing to give. Perhaps there is something else you wish that I can help?~
@22497 = ~Perhaps just a few questions, m'lord? Some history of you and yours?~
@22498 = ~You have nothing I want, we have determined this already. Take your cloak and leave me.~
@22499 = ~A tale or two, perhaps? Or just pleasant chatter for a time? Tell me of yourself.~
@22500 = ~Your interest is flattering, to say least. No, I am not frightened here. We are not weak, just few in number. The wall keeps those away that would harm. I am happy, though there is much out there, yes? Perhaps I will see, someday.~
@22501 = ~No one is what they are at first glance. Not even you, no matter how you try. I see you with some merit, but you are rude on top and hard to know. If we offer nothing to each other, then go. Leave this place and people. We will not share our "surprises" with you. You are more animal than civilized in your manner, and that is funny for reasons you know not yet. Leave me and we. Our pack is strong without you.~
@22502 = ~I... I beg pardon? If you please, talk not to me like that. I am suddenly... uncomfortable.~
@22503 = ~Leave? I... I had not thought of it. We see so few others that it does not concern. I... I don't know.~
@22504 = ~My sincere apologies, m'lady. I meant no disrespect. Please, speak of your people.~
@22505 = ~Oh come now, I think we can speak candidly. I find this place boring, and I am working to leave. There could be room for one more when I go. Someone young, intelligent, beautiful...~
@22506 = ~I am uncomfortable as well, trying to hide my distaste for this place. You naive islanders with no ability to protect yourselves... you are weak and simple.~
@22507 = ~Perhaps that day is close at hand. You are smarter than your fellows, and would do well on the mainland. I could take you away from here.~
@22508 = ~Possibly, though you have much here that people would want, despite your isolation. I would not be quick to leave.~
@22509 = ~For a price, I could take you with me when I go.~
@22510 = ~I have nothing you would want, nor would I pay. I am happy here. We all are.~
@22511 = ~This conversation is at end. Leave me, and take your outsider talk with you. You are more animal than you look, which is funny for reasons you not know, especially since I have been civil and you have rude. Leave me.~
@22512 = ~Of course. What of your people? Speak of them.~
@22513 = ~How can you be? There is nothing here! Nothing! Just some simpleton villagers hiding from the "beasts" outside.~
@22514 = ~Perhaps you have no gold, but there are other ways to pay. Services can be rendered...~
@22515 = ~My sincere apologies, m'lady. I meant no disrespect. Please, speak of your people.~
@22516 = ~Think about it. Getting out of this backwater hole and seeing some REAL sights, with someone that appreciates intelligent and beautiful women.~
@22517 = ~Hurts nothing to consider it. There is a lot out there to see. Places you have never dreamed of.~
@22518 = ~But that is my point. I have never dreamed of elsewhere. I dream of home. The pack is happy here. Enough of this, you make me think of sadness. We speak of happier things, and of friendship new.~
@22519 = ~I agree. Tell me of your people here. What are they really like?~
@22520 = ~Oh, I don't know. I rather like talking of taking you away with me.~
@22521 = ~Bah! I think of nothing other than leaving this place, and all you simpletons.~
@22522 = ~What of them would you hear? We came to this place long ago on a ship-home, from farther west than the light sets. The explorer chartered with us and we set to the seas.

@22541 = ~And I the telling. Perhaps... perhaps I have one last task I should ask of you. Are you willing?~
@22542 = ~Aye, m'lady. Willing as always. What is it you wish?~
@22543 = ~I fear I cannot. I have pressing matters elsewhere.~
@22544 = ~I am done with errands. Find another to fetch and gather for you.~
@22545 = ~If it is your wish, I will make it so.~
@22546 = ~A small thing, smaller than the last. I have need of a few simple flowers, from just beyond the wall. They grow in only a few place, and I find them strangely alluring, as with... a few other things. Would you bring me one or two? I have a special purpose for them.~
@22547 = ~Another time, perhaps. Until then, good day to you, <CHARNAME>. I think well of you.~
@22548 = ~Well... I had though I began to know you, but you surprise with unkind. Leave me then. Enjoy your stay, though it must be short.~
@22549 = ~I will return as soon as possible.~
@22550 = ~I suppose this one is for free as well?~
@22551 = ~Please do. I will be here.~

@22608 = ~Spirit Armor~
@22609 = ~Spirit Armor (Necromancy)
Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None
This spell is very similar to the 3rd level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates a corporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless, and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor, however the dexterity bonus still applies, as well as magic rings and a shield. While in effect the AC (armor class) of the recipient will be 1, as if he was wearing plate mail. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, he will also receive a +3 bonus to save vs. magical attacks.

There is a danger however, as when the spell runs out the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon the target.~
@22610 = ~Chaos~
@22611 = ~Chaos (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Up to 60-foot cube
Saving Throw: Special
The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th level spell confusion in all respects. The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking, either friend or foe. If the victim is 4th level or lower, he does not receive a saving throw versus the effects. However if the victim is 5th level or higher, he receives a save vs. spell at -4. The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful dispel magic is cast.~
@22612 = ~Feeblemind~
@22613 = ~Feeblemind (Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg
Feeblemind causes the subject's intellect to degenerate to that of a moronic child. The subject remains in this state until a successful dispel magic is cast upon them. The victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@22614 = ~Domination~
@22615 = ~Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: line of sight of caster
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
The domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th level priest spell mental domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals, except of course a dispel magic. The target gets a saving throw vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@22616 = ~Hold Monster~
@22617 = ~Hold Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 5
Range: Visual range of caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 60 foot cube
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
This spell holds 1d4 creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for nine or more rounds, unless a save vs. spell is made with a -2 penalty.
The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also effected. Those who succeed on their saving throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.
Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@22618 = ~Mental Domination~
@22619 = ~Mental Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Sphere: Thought
Range: visual sight of caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Negates Effect
When cast upon a subject, he must make a save vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the priest entering his mind. The effects of this spell are similar to the wizard spell domination, with a few minor differences. First this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell duration. To control the subject the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. Also, this requires a moderate amount of concentration from the priest, so he may enter combat and attack, however he cannot cast another spell.~
@22620 = ~Protection from Lightning~
@22621 = ~Protection from Lightning (Abjuration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: Touch
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Creature touched
Saving Throw: None
When the spell is cast it confers complete invulnerability to Electrical attack, such as lightning bolts, shocking grasp, etc. The protection will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.~

@22661 = ~L-leave? No, I cannot. Some others might wish to, but there is no place for we elsewhere. You cannot know... No, I must stay, and you will have to go. I have enjoyed our time, and will think of you well, but now I must stop this. Leave me, please.~
@22662 = ~M-my affections are worthless to you? Oh, you are not the person I thought you were. Such a cruel trick to play. Get away from me! I will speak no more, outsider!~
@22663 = ~W-what? Oh, you move too fast suddenly, and I feel... uncomfortable. Please, I am not so much animal as you seem to wish. I... I must go. I think well of you but... but this is too much. Goodbye.~

@22694 = ~The Vampire's Revenge~
@22695 = ~It would seem that the very speculation of this weapon's existence has conspired to pull it from the realm of fantasy and into the everyday, though, as with all things that come from dreams, it is not as it truly seems. The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; though not in the manner the finder might have hoped. It is rumored that the blade, instead of performing as one might think a vampiric blade would, was actually constructed by vampires as a trap for those that could eventually oppose them. These incredibly clever fiends have apparently fashioned numerous versions of these unfortunate blades over time, and they are the bane of all right-thinking adventurers. Each swing actually inflicts damage upon the wielder, as his life energies are drained in order to heal his intended victim. Were this not enough, the weapon is cursed so as to prevent its removal, and the user is smitten with a wasting of the mind, that he might not even think of trying to rid himself of it. This may be among the few magical treasures that are simply not worth the trouble of seeking, and one might better spend one's time having a lovely beverage, rather than gallivanting about the wilderness with a pack full of rubbish-chasing phantoms.

The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat.

This enchanted club is said to have existed since the time of the fall of Netheril and the birth of the great Anauroch Desert. While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims of this age were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

@22801 = ~Is greed all that brought you here? Even my young friends thought more of themselves than that. We were not scavengers; we were adventurers, testing ourselves against obstacles. Such fools we were, and you are too. It is gold you seek? Is it worth your lives? That will be the cost.~

@22814 = ~Amazing! You said that so utterly deadpan I almost believe you think it is true. It will do you no good, you know. Thrust your chest out and bellow as you will, the creature ahead will pay you no mind, and neither will the walls of this place.~

@22823 = ~Hope? I lost hope when I heard their screams, and knew that I could not help. I cannot even attempt the creature that is to come. Have you not seen? Or heard? The worst is that it did not even bother to lift a finger itself. They fought themselves, or monsters shaped as such. I suppose it was fitting, given the history of this place. Don't speak to me of hope. My friends are dead.~

Alone it could destroy all of you, but that's only if it decides you are worthy of the effort. My friends went ahead and challenged it like it was some shambling skeleton, and it LAUGHED at them! It didn't even bother to lift its sword!~
@22829 = ~Defensive Harmony~
@22830 = ~Defensive Harmony
(Enchantment/Charm)
Level: 4
Sphere: Law
Range: Caster
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None
Defensive Harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enchanted coordination of their attacks and defenses. This allows a group of creatures to act as a single unit for a single battle or encounter. The effect is always centered on the caster but affects all those within a 10 foot radius. The affected can move outside of this after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of the harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +2 bonus to his armor class. This lasts for 10 rounds or until successfully dispelled.~

@22832 = ~Protection from Evil 10' Radius
(Abjuration)
Level: 4
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: None
When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 10' radius are affected individually by Protection from Evil. It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and second any saving throws caused by such attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.~
@22833 = ~Champion's Strength~
@22834 = ~Champion's Strength (Alteration)
Level: 5
Sphere: Law
Range: visual sight of caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: One creature
Saving Throw: None
When this spells is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of his god strength and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target gains a bonus to his THAC0 at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster. So a 9th level priest would confer a THAC0 bonus of 3 to the target, and so on. Also the target's strength is set to 18/00 for the duration of the spell, and all the bonuses to hit and damage that this strength confers. Note also that if the target's strength is above 18/00, it will actually be reduced to this value.
The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and his god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time. The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~

... will return once we have again seen far off shores. The men are restless, but the promise of wealth rivaling our last voyage will keep them well in line...

... weather is clear and we shall make Anchorome in goodly time, of that I have no doubt...

... have calmed the crew, though nervouse they will remain. I blame them not, for it was not a pleasante encounter in the least. Bloody elves would do well to remember that the sea belongs to no one, save the gods that guard her. I shall avoide the northerly passage just the same, if only to prevent another overzealouse boarding party. Such paranoia from the "fair folk"...

... arrived in Anchorome, and I am remembered by a goodly number of people, not all fondly...

... but "his grace" has deemed me worthy to proceed through his lands. I am quite sure the two hundred-strong complement of the Wandering Eye aided in the decision. Still, we were received in goode humore, and I will not request tribute...

... adventure it has been! Such wealth as this... only in the deepest ruins of home. Here it is almost for the taking, with only a measure of "diplomatic" discussions as the cost...

... attacked, and barely made it to the ship in time. Dradeel did warn of such, but who is to trust a worde from his mouth? I do sweare, his senses seem addled at the best of times...

... the crew, but a larger share for the remaining will keep them well and truly happy. I shall conscript replacements from the local populace this night, and we shall set our sails at dawn...

... delays, but with one hundred and fifty new hands, one must expect the going to be slow at the start. They seem quite calm and orderly, not at all as I expected...

... should have searched! We cast him out, but his words... eady inflamed the crew. I know not what was worse, the shaman's constant... or the reaction of the crew when he was committed to the sea. Their eyes are... and resigned. I dislike a crew with no fire in their bellies, but I do suppose it is better than a fire in the hold...

... weather unseasonable, and the moode does worsen. As well, beetles have beset the foode stores, and we shall surely be hungry long before reaching the coast of home...

... set aground to forage. It is a small isle, but will yield what we need. Perhaps I shall... on my own while the crew... time on land will do them goode...

... original men seem quite shallow in the face, quite different from the pallor of the new recruits, but all are most definitely ill...~

It created doubles of them all, and laughed as they literally killed themselves. I heard Dalton screaming loudest. I think he actually killed his double, but couldn't handle the fact that he had to. He was the youngest... they didn't know, and they missed the one shot they may have had...~
@22873 = ~I have heard of such things, but never thought I would be damned enough to see one. The creature was not shy about talking about it, the smug bastard. He's got a Mirror of Opposition, or something like it. All who glimpse it get duplicated and must fight themselves. If they fail, they die. If they win, they have still killed their likeness. I have heard that it sometimes drives a person mad, but I never thought... there's a slim chance, but I wouldn't survive a second in there.~
@22874 = ~We weren't complete idiots. We didn't come down here to fight a demon knight, we came for the dungeon. Equally stupid I guess, but you never expect to die. Wouldn't leave the house if you did. My friends missed their one shot and paid for it, and now I can't help them.~

@22883 = ~What is this "one shot" you mentioned? You have already called this creature unbeatable, so how effective could it have been?~
@22884 = ~I've had some time to think about it. I couldn't go forward and I couldn't go back the way we came. That thing in there might even know I'm out here. I doubt it cares, but something it said made me think. The Mirror of Opposition it used must be very powerful... maybe it's powerful enough to do the same thing to the demon knight itself. The legends I've heard is that they have some resistances, but who knows with magic? The rules are not always carved in stone.~
@22885 = ~Weaklings. I will assault the creature head-on and destroy him before he realizes!~

@22893 = ~So I should find the mirror and turn it on him? That sounds too easy.~
@22894 = ~I know. I doubt the mirror will be easily accessible, and even if it is, you may be exposed as well. I got a peek at the room and it is not large. Everyone inside may be affected.~

At... at least the demon knight has been stopped. I hope we've seen that last of his kind... it worries me though. I have heard they serve powerful beings even more evil than they, if such a thing is possible. I... I'd better go.~
@22899 = ~You... you made it! Dalton ran out faster than I've ever seen him move. Did anyone else... no, they are dead, aren't they? At least Dalton's mother will sleep well tonight. I doubt he'll be going on any more adventures anytime soon. Neither will I, for that matter. At least you stopped the demon knight, though... though it worries me.

@22963 = ~You may ask what you wish, but you will get no answers. Die you will, but I know well that the dead do not hold their tongues as well as they should. Understanding is beyond you; dying, your only option. I will take your heads with my own blade; you have served well and have earned the honor.~
@22964 = ~Your flesh shows its weakness and stupidity. You understand only mortal gains: wealth, luxury, lust. You have no more a chance to understand me than defeat me. I will kill you with my own hands, and perhaps you will realize the error of your challenges.~
@22965 = ~A mere toy. There is value in the suffering it causes, but you will not have its gift. It is cracked and malfunctioning, though it still does a measure of what is intended. I will repair it and await more adventurers who wish to test their resolve. You will have the honor of dying by my very hand, as reward for your unintentional service. You have descended deep and found naught but doom. Such a waste.~

@22968 = ~You have come. I suppose it was inevitable. You weathered Durlag's Tower, so breaching our meager defenses would be a minor feat. It is of little concern. In a matter of seconds creatures such as you will be powerless before us.~
@22969 = ~Why would you do this? The beast you mean to raise is not to be trusted!~
@22970 = ~You may jabber as you wish! I will be standing in your blood before you finish!~

@22972 = ~By all that is right and holy, you will not succeed!~
@22973 = ~Perhaps we should join together? You will need powerful allies.~
@22974 = ~Pray tell how you would know this? Have you prepared the rituals, spoken the incantations? I have, and the assurances of Aec'Letec were the fruits of my labors! Certainly the denizens of the lower planes are prone to falsehoods, but only when dealing with the weak and stupid! We shall be strong and fitting allies for this new master! Here I break that dagger, and here the new lord comes!~
@22975 = ~Grand threats for someone so close to death. There will be much blood shed in the next age; much more than you and your meager blades and spells will manage. Aec'Letec has spoken in my fever-dreams, and we are assured of power beyond comprehension! Your souls will feed his rise! The dagger is broken! Let the new lord arise!~
@22976 = ~I will not choose now.~
@22977 = ~Adventurers, you must leave this place. These are the spawn of the cursed ones that murdered us so many years ago. They have broken into two factions. The dark ones inhabit the ship and the lighter ones have built this town. These ones have built a ship. If you hurry you may yet escape.~
@22978 = ~Where is this ship?~
@22979 = ~What else have you discovered?~
@22980 = ~We have no need of your help, elf.~
@22981 = ~The ship lies beyond the mountains to the east. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship. I warn you now, the way is fraught with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. The chieftain's woman is at the boat right now. Hurry friends! I thank you for my freedom. Would that I had the power to help you escape myself. Ah, well, perhaps we shall meet again someday and I will repay you for your assistance.~
@22982 = ~This headwoman, Kaishas, had the ship built months ago. She has been waiting for her husband, Selaad to return with maps that they might use to return to the mainland. At present, she only knows that it is east. She has gone to the ship that they have built. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in. There is a hidden door in this hut. The caves will lead you to the ship. I warn you now, the way is fraught with peril. Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. Hurry friends! I thank you for my freedom. Would that I had the power to help you escape myself. Ah, well, perhaps we shall meet again someday and I will repay you for your assistance.~
@22983 = ~Be as rude as you wish. For your help earlier, I will give you this advice. I have discovered a series of caves, warrens really, that the wolf monstrosities live in.

Head east through the caves and you may find the exit. Hurry friends! I thank you for my freedom. Perhaps we shall meet again someday.~
@22984 = ~How shallow do you think me that I would give up my destiny after a few short words with you? Have you no strength to YOUR convictions? I have no pity for your kind! You will be swept aside! You are already too late, and a new age rises! Behold Aec'Letec! Born of the Nine Hells, but destined to walk the prime! The dagger is broken! Behold your new lord and master!~
@22985 = ~Heroic friends, I am sorry for what is happening. I fear that we are led by one with evil heart. In the large hut northwest of here, there is a hidden door that leads to our homes below the ground. Within you shall find an exit to the ship.~
@22986 = ~Your home is no place for my people. Take the ship and go. With the evil ones dead we can make a good life on our island. Farewell! Peladan will grow to learn of your courage.~
@22987 = ~I am still surprised that you saved my child at all. You do not seem the least bit heroic. It is better that you take the ship and leave us here. We would never wish to live with such as you.~

It may be ready, but without seachart they could not sail. Some say the chieftain left on another ship, to find the way. I think we should stay; there is naught but fight and conflict elsewhere. The secret door is in the north of the hut. You may have seen, but it was magically closed. Now it will work, because Kaishas has gone through. Go! I will defend you to the death, for my spirit has already passed in the face of my compatriots' intolerance. They are not the friends I thought I knew. If you are gone, perhaps they will calm. Go now!~

@22994 = ~You are correct that we shall need powerful allies. How fortunate for us that we are summoning one and will not need you! You would dare suggest that you should be granted immunity from the coming storm, just because you feign loyalty at this moment? We have worshiped for years upon years, and planned for this day to the exclusion of all else! You are but spit in the ocean, and unworthy! Your time is past! Aec'Letec will deliver you from life! The dagger is broken! Witness the new lord arise!~
@22995 = ~By all that is loud and windy, will you please shut up! You can pose all you wish, but you have failed! Here will come the new lord, despite your slogans! Here will come the new lord, despite your puny weapons! Here will come the new lord, Aec'Letec! Born of the Nine Hells, let he who was imprisoned walk the prime! The dagger is broken! I release you!~

@22997 = ~It came to pass that the hero Durlag and his man-at-arms, Arlo Stoneblade, ventured into the bowels of the Great Rift. They fought the hideous tanar'ri Aec'Letec and with a single blow of his axe, Durlag slew the demon's body and entrapped its soul in an enchanted dagger.~

@23024 = ~Ah, yes, the debt. Perhaps you may waive your duty to me if you give me something else instead. Have you anything of value?~
@23025 = ~I have no need of your service. Consider whatever it is you owe to be settled. I release you from any contract we may have had. Leave and be free.~
@23026 = ~What is it you think you owe... me? What do you hope to repay?~
@23027 = ~You need not have waited so long. Perhaps if you paid through some other means you might rest easy. Have you anything else I might take as payment? Anything... valuable?~
@23028 = ~You speak of debts from an age long since past. Consider it settled, and go get some rest. I'll hear no more of this. You are free to leave whenever you wish.~

Your clan was a refuge to me, to my family until... you fought them off when I could not strike my... my children changed to doubles... you... you have no need of wealth; we waded through dragon hoards and left with empty pockets, you and I. You have changed much since you... since I... death... death took us both! You are not Durlag! He valued family over all! You are invaders! I will repel you and he will rest easy! I will repay!~
@23031 = ~You speak of the old like it does not matter... you know better. When the hordes came wearing the faces of friends, you fought when I would not... could not strike... I was an outsider among your clan, and you defended when all did turn against... I was released from life... but never from debt. Do not turn me away... a friend would not turn me... you are different... you are not the same... you are not Durlag! I will defend!~
@23032 = ~The debt? You know the debt... when the evil came and took the faces of your clan, when your friends and mine became evil unmatched... you protected and fought though it pained. I could not harm... I could not strike at the clan I called family... you fought them all... though it hurt you more...

@23074 = ~Welcome to the game of Chess. You have just defeated the last of the four elemental guardians and so this is your next stop. I hope your stay within my tower has been pleasant, but if you have been bored, I have included this game to spice things up somewhat. There are some rules that must be adhered to while playing the game. The first one is to stay on your respective squares. Your King cannot move from his square, your queen may move into any square. The black bishop must stay to the black squares, while the white bishop keeps to the white square. The knights can travel anywhere, but always take the risk of some pain. IF you move into a square that is restricted to you, lightning will be sent to punish your transgression.~
@23075 = ~Remember, when one king falls the game is done.~
@23076 = ~You should be nervous. If anything were to... happen... to you in here, no one could say it wasn't just another adventurer dying in some dungeon.~

@23095 = ~It's a terrible story, really. Wandered in some time ago, and it's just not safe to leave on my own. So many dangers, and no protective hand to guide me. I'm almost without hope... would you... would you stay here with me? It's so lonely here.~
@23096 = ~Sorry, m'lady, I simply have not the time for this. However, I will see to it that the way out is cleared for you.~

Durlag and his curse be damned, you'll stay here instead of me and you'll damn well like it! He took my wings, but I've still a few tricks at my disposal!~
@23101 = ~Excellent, though "a little while" is not quite what I had in mind. You see, there's a matter of a teeny weeny curse that that mean ol' Durlag put on me. A tiny thing really, but I need your help. You want to help me, don't you? Hmm? I need someone brave and strong to do something for me. I need you to stay here instead of me. Will you do this? Will you do this for me?~
@23102 = ~No, I'll be leaving now. I'll try and clear a passage for you to leave, but I cannot help you other than that.~

@23104 = ~Durlag put this curse on you? But he has not been seen in over three hundred years.~
@23105 = ~Your offer is not quite what I require. I really must insist. I really must demand! I'll not sit here another three hundred years because of you! You will stay here! That bastard Durlag took my wings and imprisoned me, but I can still deal with your puny mortal mind! I'll not end up like Aec! I'll not!~
@23106 = ~Oh, a short amount of time... relatively speaking. A mere drop in the bucket compared to the lives of elves or dragons... or gods. I figure I have about another four hundred years to go before the dweomers weaken enough to simply walk out. You're lucky. You'll die of starvation long before then.~
@23107 = ~What manner of creature are you that would propose such a thing? I'll not die for you if you have been imprisoned justly.~
@23108 = ~That's a rather different proposition that you were saying earlier. I think I'll be going now.~
@23109 = ~Time is of little real consequence to my kind. More important is that you mortals obey and behave! Such indignity that I have been trapped here since that fool Durlag disappeared, and now I have to deal with your rejection as well?! Durlag may have taken my wings and cursed me to remain here, but I've still a few powers his traps couldn't strip! If I cannot leave, neither will you!~
@23110 = ~Do your worst! I will see you dead!~
@23111 = ~Wait! What if I could get someone else to take your place? What would that be worth to you?~
@23112 = ~Such insolence! I tire of placating fools trying to entice them! As if imprisonment is not enough, I must also play games with such as you? Such indignity that I have been trapped here since that fool Durlag disappeared, and now I have to deal with your rejection as well?! Durlag may have taken my wings and cursed me to remain here, but I've still a few powers his traps couldn't strip! If I cannot leave, neither will you!~

@23114 = ~Wait! What if I could get someone else to take your place? What would that be worth to you?~
@23115 = ~I shall repaint the walls with your blood! A little re-decorating will make the next hundred years a little more bearable!~
@23116 = ~Another? You would do this? Oh, you are deliciously wicked. Perhaps there is a way. Take this lock of my hair, and find someone near this place. Tell them it is a lock of nymph's hair. If you can pass it to another mortal male and they accept it, they will be accepting part of me. That will free me and imprison him here for the rest of his life. They must be within the tower for the enchantment to work. Such an act will undoubtedly reflect in your karma as the magics of this place are powerful indeed, but I will be oh sooo grateful. You'll like me when I'm grateful. Will you do this for me? Will you? So what if some fool starves to death here?~
@23117 = ~I cannot be a party to something so monstrous! I will remove your taint from this place! Defend yourself, fell creature!~
@23118 = ~I will do this for you, but you shall owe me a favor though. Perhaps several. I'm sure we can arrange something.~
@23119 = ~We shall see, mortal. It is within my power to give you delights unearthly. Do not fail me.~
@23120 = ~You have not yet released me from the spell! Why have you returned?!~
@23121 = ~There was another candidate here, but I killed him. I can find no one else.~
@23122 = ~I will continue searching as best I can.~
@23123 = ~I have changed my mind! I will make no deals with such as you!~
@23124 = ~Do so. I grow impatient.~
@23125 = ~I am... I am free! I can feel the chains lifted! My powers return! I'll have my wings back before I reach the third plane of home! You have done as you said, and we had a fair and equitable bargain. What was it I promised? Unearthly delights and all that? It really is a pity that I had no intention of honoring our little bargain. I leave you your life, however, and I will refrain from dragging you down when I return home. My kind will see you again, though. Your type is destined to meet mine.~

@23177 = ~Greetings adventurers. So many of you have come down to loot the ancient basements of Durlag, yet none ever return. Adventurers are not known for their wisdom, otherwise they'd have chosen a safer profession. Take the five people that stand behind me, forever frozen in stone. Each one of these foolish men and women came to find Durlag's treasure. Now they stand vigil over Durlag's bestiary. Most of the other creatures have long disintegrated to dust, but the great wyrm known as Mechezarin still hangs in its original repose of death. Breathtaking, isn't he?~

@23187 = ~If you travel further into the room you will find the only living creatures that remain within the bestiary. These winged beasts have lived for centuries, augmented by ancient and powerful magics. None so far have been able to defeat them. However, if you wish to defeat the terrible beasts, there is help available to you. Each of the statues behind me houses the cursed body of some poor hero. By depressing the button at the base of each statue, you will release the ancient hero. The hero is enspelled to serve you for a short time, but after that time has run out he'll take his revenge on he who dared command him. There's nothing more for me to say. Goodbye now.~

@23193 = ~Three hundred...? What are you up to? You... you trying to butter me up? You got no reason to give me this. Well, alright then. You ain't so bad after all. Maybe I've been wrong about you... maybe. You're alright... but don't be hangin' around too long anyway, lest I change my mind.~
@23194 = ~What are you up to?! Ain't no way you'd give up something like that for no reason! I don't trust you at all!~
@23195 = ~Aww, I'm just a friendly person. I just want to do this for you out of the goodness of my heart.~
@23196 = ~Don't get all bent outta shape; I'm just trying to be neighborly!~
@23197 = ~Don't you get it? I'm trying to buy you off so I don't get a dagger in my backside while I'm resting. Something you would do if given half the chance, right?~
@23198 = ~That's the thanks I get? I've about had enough of you! If you are determined to fight, let's get it over with!~
@23199 = ~I have no need of it, and I thought you might. If you do not want it, all you have to do is say so.~
@23200 = ~Wha... what? You're giving me... I guess I was wrong about you. I guess you're a pretty decent person after all. Here, friend, here's a little toy I found myself. Fair trade for an honest person. Riggilo will speak well of your name to anyone who asks.~

@23202 = ~Alright then. NO! That plain enough for you? I don't need your stinkin' nymph's hair, and I don't need you poking around. Get outta here! I trust you about as far as I could throw you!~
@23203 = ~Oh all right! I'll take the blasted hair! Consider yourself safe around me, but that don't mean I like or trust you. Get going!~
@23204 = ~Thanks for the interesting little gift, friend. Looks like it'll fetch a nice price. I guess you ain't so bad. Riggilo will not harm you. You're all right.~
@23205 = ~I warned you to get lost! Now you'll pay the price!~
@23206 = ~You! I can't leave this place! I can't even get near the stairs. You did something! Damned me to be trapped here! I'll see you dead! I'll see you dead for killing me, you evil bastard!~

It was majestic in those times, and we took what we needed from the fortune around us. We grew strong and proud, and Durlag felt he finally had a home.

@23355 = ~Your ship sets its sails against the morning light and you are off across the waves. The Sea of Swords allows your passage without incident, and in a scant amount of time you are on to truly open waters. A score or more of days pass, but the aptly named Trackless Sea seems to stretch before you without end. The waters are calm, though the wind remains steady and sure.

The merchant vessel your employer has chartered is a fine ship, but her crew is not accustomed to journeys so far off the established trade routes. The more superstitious among them speak of a great waterfall off the edge of Faer'n, of a secret Elven nation that scuttles all that dare come near, or even of island-size turtles that eat whole ships. Such fancy weighs heavily on the minds of nervous sailors, and the mood aboard ship slowly turns. Tensions begin to mount, and rumors of mutiny threaten your resolve. It is a mixed blessing that all aboard are soon given a very real danger to occupy their thoughts.

The storm comes without warning, and hits with a fury that seems almost deliberate. Gale force winds toss the ship about like a cork, and it is all the crew can do to keep her afloat. Their efforts, though valiant, are ultimately futile, and when the mainmast splinters you know the ship is lost. As the hull gives way there is a glimpse of something in the distance: a steady illumination against the black of night. Grasping debris for flotation you abandon the wreck, and begin to swim under the heavy burden of your equipment. You head towards the glow, hoping it is not a sea wisp or some other nefarious trick of the eyes.

You awake the next morning with a mouth full of sand. You are waterlogged, exhausted, and you have an aching pain that lets you know you are very much alive. The ship is so much kindling, there is no sign of the crew, but there do appear to be footprints in the sand...~ [TSCNA01]
@23356 = ~The journey home is mercifully without incident, though the events on the isle you left behind continue to weigh heavily on your mind. On the surface it would seem that you have succeeded in your mission, and found the remnants of the legendary Balduran's ship, if not the ultimate fate of the man himself. The cost of this information was high however, both for you and for the island's inhabitants. Aside from their missing chieftain they will never leave their island home, though likely this is for the best of all concerned.

You have left with your life and a rich reward awaits your return to the mainland. Mendas will be waiting to hear of your triumph, and it is quite a tale you have to tell.~ [TSCNA02]

@23362 = ~And just who might you be? Answer carefully, because they will be your last words.~
@23363 = ~What manner of beast are you? Speak, poor creature.~
@23364 = ~And your goodness will not help me, or any of my kind. All in this place are beyond the help of mortals. I am Grael, and I like you I was. I fought the evil that dared to walk the earth, and this was the reward for me. I stared down the gaze of none other than a Tanar'ri, and my flesh did fail. Beware you well the death gaze of the beasts of Hell.~
@23365 = ~Well, thanks for the warning. I'll be sure to remember it. Go on with whatever you were doing. I'll be going now.~
@23366 = ~My heart positively bleeds for you. Thank you for your concern, but I have no need of advice from failures.~
@23367 = ~I will heed your warning. Is there nothing I can do to ease your suffering? I cannot stay long, but there must be something.~
@23368 = ~Your warning is unnecessary. I know well how to handle creatures of evil, just as I know how I must handle you. You misery must be stopped. Your evil lives cause you pain, and must be ended.~
@23369 = ~My last words? Last words I spoke when my body died. I like to think there was much lamenting when Grael fell, but it was but a sidebar. Durlag entrapped the beast, and his was the victory blow that is legend. A great evil, but not even the fight that is remembered in this tower. My reward is undeath. My reward is the curse of this place and the madness that claimed it.~
@23370 = ~The runeglow feels warm beneath your feet. There is the sensation of becoming air, somehow.~
@23371 = ~I encountered a ghoul of great power, named Grael. He offered a warning about something called a Tanar'ri, and the horrible "death-gaze" it wields. A "gaze that is not a gaze." Sounds more insidious than even the gaze of the basilisk. I wonder if the traditional precautions will even function against it? I shall keep this in mind, though I doubt I will meet such a creature. It has been ages since Grael's battle took place.~
@23372 = ~An interesting tale, but I cannot stay to hear the rest. I'll be going now.~
@23373 = ~Such a heartbreaking story. A pity it was wasted on me. Take your whining away, ghoul, I have little time for it.~
@23374 = ~I must be leaving shortly. Is there nothing I can do to ease your suffering?~
@23375 = ~Unfortunate beast, made evil by circumstance. I will end your suffering that your soul might rest!~
@23376 = ~Poor creature? Poor creature?! Words of sympathy I not need! This place is an eternal tomb for the victims of battle long forgotten, and you offer pity?! Even untwisted I would laugh, but now I even hate! You who walk here just as I did; you will fall as I did from an enemy just as unthinkable! The difference is that Durlag will not be there to take the credit of victory! We fought the demon also! We fought also!! Legend speaks of him, not of undead also-foughts!~
@23377 = ~Scimitar +1~
@23378 = ~The long, curved, single edged blade is characteristic of both the sabre and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different part of Faerun. Where as the sabre was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder.

@23381 = ~Your unfortunate fate is horrible. Is there nothing I can do to help you before I go?~

@23383 = ~A Tanar'ri? A beast from Hell? Of what creature do you speak?~
@23384 = ~Of what great evil do you speak? Is this different than the assault on the Tower I have heard of?~
@23385 = ~An unthinkable enemy? Of what do you speak?~
@23386 = ~An evil so grand only fools chase and fight. A Tanar'ri true and horrible. Its name you do not speak unless its attention you wish to bring. Long before it walked and stalked, long before even the fall of the tower. We fought along with Durlag to encase the evil away. His was the blow that won, and ours were the souls that lost. Here we stay, turned to evil an unredeemable, but heroes still and not to be killed! A cruel charity! Durlag is legend and we are a pity! Beware the gaze that is not a gaze, but a look into your soul!~
@23387 = ~Your tale is interesting, but anything said by a ghoul should be taken with a grain of salt. I'll be going now.~
@23388 = ~I can handle whatever comes my way without advice from the dead, thank you very much. Goodbye.~
@23389 = ~I wish I could help you and restore your hope. Is there nothing I can do before I go?~
@23390 = ~You are an abominations of what you once were. I will aid your soul by destroying your evil form!~
@23391 = ~You run because you are fearful of what we are... what I am? You will see much worse here, and places yet unknown. If you cannot stomach what I have become, then you will surely fall to others. I will do a service for you! I will show you suffering here! You may survive elsewhere if you survive here, and if you die you will have been spared the waiting and worrying. This I do for you!~
@23392 = ~I will not be dismissed! We go unknown for so long, joined only by death and more death! You will not walk away ignoring! You will remember and take my name from this place! You will remember the pain I give you!~
@23393 = ~Is there anything? You can do nothing! You can do nothing except... you can take my name from this place. You can take the memory of battle and my name and I will be free from the shadow of Durlag and that damnable demon. Fight now, that you can say true that we battle ferocious! You will take the memory from here!~
@23394 = ~Naive righteous fury! That is what I was armed with as well! Here is where it led, and here is where you will be too if you do not judge your targets carefully, as well as harshly. I speak from the dead with experience. You who were like me... you who are as I was... your existence mocks mine! You wish to cleanse this place? You are welcome to try!~
@23395 = ~I've been told I should talk to someone named Kaishas, and she will make sure I am not thought a threat by the villagers.~
@23396 = ~I met some wench named Delainy. She seemed to have some errand she wanted me to run, but I do not have the time.~
@23397 = ~I met some fool named Durlyle. He seemed to have some errand he wanted me to run, but I do not have the time.~
@23398 = ~I have met the village historian, a woman by the name of Delainy. She seemed rather nice, actually. I have agreed to help her with a small problem she was having. It seems that an important symbol for her village, a cloak, blew away from the chieftain's hut in the recent storm. It is probably outside the walls, so I shall have to watch out for the "beasts" that the locals keep mentioning. I shall have to ask Delainy to tell me more about her people when I get back. I'm sure she won't mind.~

@23403 = ~I returned the village cloak to that Durlyle person. He was grateful enough, though I think he doesn't like me all that much.~
@23404 = ~The villagers came to this place long ago, after being marooned. They were from the far west, and someone called "the explorers" brought them. There was a great storm that their elders said "could have come from within," or some such. Their people were to be cast out—they were probably thought of as ballast—and they fought. They survived and made a home here.~
@23405 = ~Grael~
@23406 = ~Grael~
@23407 = ~Balduran was one of the explorers that brought them to this place. He apparently tried to scuttle the ship they were on, rather than let them go. They do not know what happened to him after that, and they don't care.~
@23408 = ~This machinery seem somehow connected to the burial chamber to the north. There is a lever to pull, but it can only be operated with a key of some sorts.~
@23409 = ~Apparently no villager left alive knows exactly what happened on the ship that brought them here. They were bound, and now they are free.~
@23410 = ~The mystery of this island has become clear. Mendas/Selaad sent us to the island on the false pretenses of retrieving evidence from what was believed to be Balduran's shipwreck. It was indeed the adventurer's ship, though his personal fate yet remains a mystery. Balduran's crew were infected with lycanthropy sometime during that fateful voyage. The ship was beached and wrecked leaving the two strains of lycanthropes, werewolves and wolfweres, to fight amongst themselves for survival. The more organized werewolves built the village that we recently shipwrecked near on our own fateful voyage. The chaotic wolfweres took residence in the ruins of Balduran's ship and both packs survived in uneasy co-existence since then. Mendas/Selaad eventually took the risk of sailing for the mainland. Somehow he made it and, upon discovering that someone had finally found the island, made up a plausible tale and had us first steal the sea charts, and later travel to the island to put them in his werewolf mate's hands. She had us kill the wolfweres and then infected the party with lycanthropy, intending us to join the pack or die fighting. We killed her, took the charts and sailed home to finally discover the truth of Mendas' duplicity. Fate seems to enjoy toying with me.~
@23411 = ~They haven't indicated exactly what they mean when they say "they belong." Outsiders do not belong, and they do. Probably some sort of ritual to become a citizen.~
@23412 = ~I seem to have made Delainy mad at me, though I think she is just touchy and unused to my kind of person. She said I was more animal than civilized, and that their pack was strong without me. As if I would want to stay here with them anyway. Delainy had a nice manner though. Ahh well, plenty of fish in the sea.~
@23413 = ~Hirelings return. Master Selaad awaits thee.~
@23414 = ~You are mistaken, good fellow. We return to meet Mendas of Waterdeep.~
@23415 = ~Who is this Selaad you speak of?~
@23416 = ~Out of my way, fool. I haven't the patience this evening.~
@23417 = ~The master has many names on this accursed soil. Selaad is the only true one. It is not thy concern.~
@23418 = ~This tale grows thicker with each telling. Is Mendas, or Selaad, if you will, the mate of Kaishas Gan?~
@23419 = ~I will decide whether or not it is my concern. Who are you?~
@23420 = ~Selaad Gan is the chief of the true people. He awaits the return of his mate Kaishas. Why have thee not returned with her?~
@23421 = ~It is not your place to question me. What part do you play in this?~

@23436 = ~It is not your business. Step aside.~
@23437 = ~Thy task was clear. Travel to the island-home and retrieve master's kin. Failing that, Kaishas was to take the sea charts from thee. Useless manlings! Selaad does not brook failure well.~
@23438 = ~Idiot! We were sent on false pretences and somehow it is our fault? Kaishas attacked us and we were forced to defend ourselves. Mendas was betrayed by his own cleverness.~

@23445 = ~I think I have disappointed Durlyle somehow. Foolish boy, perhaps he thought I was interested in him. He seemed nice enough, but I will not stay here longer than I have to.~
@23446 = ~I have agreed to fetch some flowers for Delainy. 'Tis hardly what I would call work. I might have brought them to her anyway. I think I am growing rather fond of the woman.

@23457 = ~Seek direction... understand the path... and the way will yield... three paths lead away... all are necessary... understand them to return...~
@23458 = ~I have encountered a phantom... perhaps of Durlag himself. It said that the true spirit of Durlag passed long ago, but his hatred and fear that built the tower still maintains it. It said I must understand two of the "paths" that led to this place. After that, "the way" will become clear. It seems to want something as well. It said there was a new evil here, something not a part of the tower that must be expelled. I don't fancy being this creature's lackey, but I may have no choice... unless I just leave.~

'A Lovely Bun-cake Brightens Anyone's Day'

The recipes herein are mine own imagining, and thus ingredients are subject to change as per my whim.
************
Belladonna Bun-cake
A simple little dish for a rainy afternoon.

Cornflour,
The eggs of a seabird,
A spoon of the Whitecap fungus,
The fruit of your choice for sweetening,
One small measure of the belladonna root.
Prepare as one would a breadloaf, though less time given to the rising.
Bake in a well-stoked hearth under leaves for one turn of the hourglass.

Notes to myself: Refrain from eating this ever again. Exceptionally poisonous. Remember the unfortunate week on the kitchen floor.
************
Dradeel's Vegetable Surprise
A dish that turned out surprisingly edible. Not recommended as the primary meal every day for 300 years. Some disorientation may result.

Place 2 cups of virgin Netherese Olive Oil and 1 large chopped onion in a large pot
Saute onions in oil over medium fire until onions begin to become clear
Add 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped stalks of celery
Saute for an additional 3 minutes
Add 1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a boil.

Add 2 diced and peeled potatoes, 1 cup of white wine (I find that a Myth Rhynnian vintage is perfect), 1 bay leaf, 2 diced tomatoes, and chopped parsley to taste.

Cook, covered, over medium-smallish fire until vegetables are almost tender. Add 2 cups of chopped spinach and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve hot and garnish with grated cheese.

Note: For orcish version, replace all ingredients with turnips.

Curative Ingredients for the Dispelling of Lycanthropy.
Mother's family recipe

Notes: Mother's topical salve is a rather large failure. Research further with the following in mind: The creatures on this isle are unusual beyond their splitting into two factions. Theirs is an odd curse, one that defies the traditional remedies (such as the unfortunately dangerous muffins previous), though one is not without hope. The exotic origin of the original stock suggest a unique enchantment, not unlike that of the more widely known vampiric afflictions. The casual bite might be averted using such things as the Belladonna flower, but an intentional infection could actually require the extermination of the leader of the clan. This is merely conjecture of course, as I have been unable to examine said leader. Despite my strange immunity, his is a strength that could still inflict a measure of serious damage upon my physical form. He and I have spoken on occasion, though his tolerance of me is no more resilient than mine is of him.

Further notes to myself: Future offerings of peace to either of the wolven clans should not take the form of muffins of any sort.

@23505 = ~I met a loud little gnome, but was dismissed without notice. I don't think he liked me.~
@23506 = ~A gnome named Delsvirftanyon offered me the contents of his entire store. Seems he wants out of the business. I refused. His asking price was too expensive.~

@23509 = ~I have rescued a young man from the very clutches of this place. He will live, but not without some lasting effects, I am sure. He had to kill his own double, and came very close to death himself. He is young... he will survive.~

@23517 = ~I may have located the sea charts, but I need to appease Captain Tollar Kieres before I can get a good look around. He wants some swill from a man named De'Tranion. He can be found at the Blushing Mermaid tavern in Baldur's Gate.~
@23518 = ~I outwitted old Captain Tollar Kieres, though I can't say it was all that difficult. Spends a lot more time in a bottle than on the seas, I'll wager.~
@23519 = ~I tried to talk my way past Captain Tollar Kieres so I could find those blasted sea charts, but he would have none of it. Ahh well, either sneaking or fighting I'll leave no witnesses.~
@23520 = ~I met a villager by the name of Evalt, but I don't think I left a very good impression. Bah! He and his fellows are of no concern.~
@23521 = ~I had the unfortunate duty to tell Evalt that his brother had died. I was able to retrieve the body, but nothing more could I do.~
@23522 = ~I retrieved Farthing's dolly for her. She seemed quite happy about it.~
@23523 = ~Farthing seemed quite happy that I killed Karoug and his lot. She seemed quite calm about it, though I don't know how she could be so accustomed to violence living this peaceful place.~
@23524 = ~Some strange apparition appeared to me.
This is what it had to say:

I am the warrior's bane
I live in the darkness of his soul
I bring him to his knees,
Trembling and weeping
Unable to lift a hand in his own defense
Yet I sleep... Awaken me.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What will awaken this warder? Perhaps a loud noise like a drum or a gong. Perhaps something else. I must solve this riddle to pass.~
@23525 = ~I met some fop named Fenrus Boulon. His babble was not worth my time.~
@23526 = ~Someone named Ike is giving tours of Durlag's Tower. I would assume that they only take people through rooms that has been cleared of traps. Perhaps I should ask someone who has taken the tour. There is a man named Fenrus who has done so. I can find him near the docks.~
@23527 = ~There is another new face in town besides mine. A man named Mendas moved in just recently. He's apparently not all that friendly.~
@23528 = ~I hear rumors that someone has located Balduran's ship. He was the founder of Baldur's Gate, and an explorer of great note. No mention of where the ship is located though.~
@23529 = ~I met some roustabout named Galken. He said he had something for sale, but I'll wager it's just a bunch of garbage. Seemed like a bit of a scoundrel to me.~
@23530 = ~I bought a ward token from that scoundrel Galken, and I should have guessed there would be strings attached. He said it truly is a key for some door or another deep in the tower, but the former owner might be looking for it too. With my luck he stole it from Durlag himself, or some other powerful being.~
@23531 = ~I met a blustering lout offering tours to Durlag's Tower. Seems he aims to make a tourist attraction out of the deathtrap. I decided not to take him up on his offer, but he will be available if I change my mind.~
@23532 = ~I met a huckster by the name of Ike who was offering tours of Durlag's Tower. Seems the venerable deathtrap has become a bit of a tourist attraction. I agreed to the tour, so I should meet Ike by the tower as soon as possible. I'm sure it will be safe. They wouldn't walk people through if there was still a danger.~
@23533 = ~The tower, and labyrinth below, was built ages ago by the dwarven hero Durlag "Thunderaxe," for no less worthy a purpose than to be a home for him and his kin. His enormous fortune occupied entire rooms, rumored waist-deep on a man. The wealth Durlag accumulated was to be the backbone of his clan.~
@23534 = ~The stories of Durlag's opulence spread across the land, and the most unsavory of creatures sought to make the tower theirs. All of Durlag's kin and friends were replaced by doppelgangers, and he found himself killing the visages of those that he cared most, just to save himself. In the end he drove the invaders from his home, and vowed that none would dare the same again!~
@23535 = ~Durlag installed magical locks on the entrances to his inner sanctum, requiring ward tokens to pass. Some apparently still exist, but are likely expensive and rare.~
@23536 = ~Those that passed the wards were confronted with the fruits of the paranoia that consumed Durlag. He had traps crafted for every inch of floor and wall, and nary a step could be taken without triggering a horrendous effect.~
@23537 = ~I have agreed to try and use Ike's ward token and explore some of the lower rooms of Durlag's Tower. He seems to think that I am up to the challenge, and I agree.~
@23538 = ~I met what appeared to be one of the village's protectors, a man named Jorin. He was quite gruff, and wanted little to do with me. He didn't seem to have much confidence in my abilities.~
@23539 = ~The child is mine now! It is no concern of you.~
@23540 = ~I have seen a strange apparition. It looked to be one of Durlag's own kin at the very moment they discovered the doppelganger incursion. This "Kiel" accused a doppelganger of wearing his face and helm. Such powerful emotions to replay the event even to this day.~
@23541 = ~Then I shall make it my concern.~
@23542 = ~The child's mother has a prior claim to the boy.~
@23543 = ~I have met a woman who claims that someone named Jondal has been ambushed by wolf-men and killed. I will give chase and see that justice is served!~
@23544 = ~I met a woman in the forest that claimed a young man named Jondal had been killed by "wolf-men." It was not my problem.~
@23545 = ~An ambush! The woman tricked me into an ambush with her sorry tale! She is one of them!~
@23546 = ~I met an old farmer in the village. His name was Lahl, and he asked that I kill some of the beasts outside the village to avenge his wife. Such toil is his job, not mine.~
@23547 = ~An old farmer named Lahl asked that I kill some of the beasts outside the village to avenge his wife. It is the least I can do. Perhaps I can also arrange for these people to be able to go beyond their wall once again.~
@23548 = ~Lahl was grateful for my defeat of Karoug. I have made a lot of friends here. He said I would make a good addition to the village.~
@23549 = ~Some strange apparition appeared to me.
This is what it had to say:

I am the warrior's madness
I curse him with trust and respect
I slow the blade in its course
By stealing his passion for blood
And offering a softer emotion in return
Yet I thirst for more... Give me the sweet crimson drink of laughter and passion.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What does this warder thirst for? What drink is commonly associated with passion and where on this level would it make sense to find or make such a drink? I must solve this riddle to pass.~
@23550 = ~A young mother had some story about her child missing from the village. She thinks the creatures outside have taken it. I could not be bothered to help.~
@23551 = ~Young Maralee has her child back, and I have another friend here. Hopefully they will be careful in the future.~
@23552 = ~Maralee has told me of a secret way to get off the island. In the chieftain's hut there is a hidden door that leads to "their homes below the ground." There is apparently an exit that leads to a ship they have built.~
@23553 = ~Some old dodder named Mendas wanted to hire me for some errand. He'll wait 'till I'm ready, and he'll like it.~
@23554 = ~Save game failed, do you wish to quit?~
@23555 = ~I have met Meym, a member of the beasts that have plagued this isle. He gave the impression that Kaishas and her people were not so different from he and his. We shall see.~
@23556 = ~As you will. Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@23557 = ~I have been attacked by Meym, one of the so-called beasts that plague this isle. He seemed to think that Kaishas was no less trouble than his own ilk, and that I was foolish to help her. We shall see.~
@23558 = ~The townsfolk are not fond of Mendas, a scholar considered a bit of a snob.~
@23559 = ~I hear rumors that the remnants of Balduran's last expedition have been found, but I think tales of his return to rule may be a touch overly optimistic. It has been several hundred years since his disappearance, after all.~
@23560 = ~There is someone else new in town, from Waterdeep apparently. He keeps to himself though.~
@23561 = ~Villainy is afoot! I have agreed to help a young man rout some "monsters" before they can do any harm. He leads the way as I write!~
@23562 = ~Ambushed! These creatures are cagey opponents!~
@23563 = ~I have met a young child, obviously this island in not uninhabited. Other storm-stranded sailors perhaps? This girl seems young for such a journey though.~
@23564 = ~I know you... oh yes, don't think I don't... you who dare to show your face here!~
@23565 = ~You are too far away to operate that device.~
@23566 = ~You have me at a disadvantage, sir. You claim to know me, but I am not acquainted with you.~
@23567 = ~You sound a little too threatening for my liking! Watch your tone, and identify yourself!~
@23568 = ~And you would be... who, exactly? I can't say I've had the pleasure.~
@23569 = ~Spare me your false pretensions and manners, I see through them as I see through light and day! And save your disgusting innocence and ignorance! You know me well and true, though we have not met in person to personal manner! My name, most foul whelp, is Shandalar! Yes, I see the dim lights of recognition in your eyes! Like a bolt from the sky, though I get ahead of myself. You did slaughter that which I held most dear! For Shaaaaame!~
@23570 = ~Shandalar... Shandalar... no, it doesn't ring any bells for me. Perhaps if you told me what it is I'm supposed to have done?~
@23571 = ~Shandalar, eh? If you have an accusation, make it quick! I have no tolerance for innuendo or veiled threats!~
@23572 = ~State your case plain and save us both some time. I have done many things, your accusations fall amidst many.~
@23573 = ~I expected such bravado from you... such is the mind of they that would prove their mettle by slaughtering three simple children! You have participated in the murder of the daughters of Shandalar and, surprisingly enough, I consider that a verrrrry naughty act! What have you to say for yourself in defense? State why I should not make interesting little noisemakers from your vertebrae and sell them to bugbear children!~
@23574 = ~You will not insult me so! That you cannot remember the incident is doubly infuriating! To have snuffed out the lights of my life and not even recall the deed is the height of indignity! Shandalar accuses, and you WILL admit!~
@23575 = ~I grow weary of this, old man. You had best change your tone before I get angry!~
@23576 = ~Shandalar...? Oh dear. Shandalar of Ulgoth's Beard? Shandalar that makes his home in a Halruaan skyship? Shandalar that charged his daughters to guard the components of such a skyship pending their sale? I've... uh... never heard of you... or your daughters.~
@23577 = ~Shandalar? I know of you. You were to sell the components of a skyship and I prevented it. Granted I did so at the cost of your daughters' lives, but you were the one that charged them with the task of guarding the items I sought. Why put them in harm's way if you were not prepared to lose them?~
@23578 = ~I know you. I was involved in the killing of your daughters in Baldur's Gate. Regrettable, but business is business.~
@23579 = ~Your daughters were more than mere "simple children." They were in Oberon's Estate because you thought them able to defend themselves. If you did not wish to risk losing them, you should have guarded the Halruuan skyship components yourself.~
@23580 = ~I still have no idea who you are. You must have me confused with someone else entirely. I have done nothing against you or your children. Honest.~
@23581 = ~I shall tell you why: because it was a matter of business and nothing personal. I was hired to prevent a deal that you orchestrated, and was forced to remove the opposition.~
@23582 = ~Your pitiful attempts and lies are as transparent to me as the nature of existence... no wait, that's still fairly opaque... but YOU, you I see clearly for I see true! Do you really believe that one versed in magic such as I could not identify those responsible for the deaths of his children? You have a long road of repentance ahead of you, and no one is offering a ride! I send you! I send you on a pitiable errand! The means of your return will be found if you look, but do not expect the way to be easy! If you do well, I may yet decide not to invert your faces! Away, away, AWAY! And bring me back a lovely souvenir! A cloak perhaps!~
@23583 = ~Your argument falls short of becoming a reason not to kill you! I suppose it is my fault and not the thief's if I am burgled in my home? After all, it is not his fault that I amassed wealth and dared to "display" it in mine home. In a mob rule you might have a chance, but I am but a mob of one! Shandalar spits at you and condemns with the same breath! You will perform a duty to me as part of penance, and if you succeed you will be a measure closer to repayment! I send you! I send you and you may not return without a lovely souvenir! A cloak perhaps!~
@23584 = ~There, you see? Was that so hard to admit? I'm sure you will agree it is better to maintain a level of honesty in all of one's dealings. Now that that is out of the way, I have a task that you WILL perform. Oh, you are still to be punished, but you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you purged your conscience ahead of time. Much more rehabilitating. You are to do me a service. I will send you where you must go, and you must return with the item I need. A simple cloak is your target, but do NOT wear it! You have already abused too much of what is mine. Go now!~
@23585 = ~Halt! You who are not worthy to walk here will stand and listen! I am Shandalar, and this town is in my protections! Such as you must prove your intent well and true, and show that you are to be allowed the same rights to life as those more responsible!~
@23586 = ~I will welcome your challenges, Shandalar. I may be of questionable karma, but I am willing to prove my worth. You say you protect this place? Well, you need not fear such as I.~
@23587 = ~I ain't going to hurt nobody. Why don't you go bother some candy-snatchers and leave me to my own business.~
@23588 = ~Who are you to judge my worthiness? I will not be told where I can or cannot go! If you wish to challenge this then do so. Save your words for someone else!~
@23589 = ~What business is it of yours where I go? If I present a danger then I am sure the local constabulary will deal with me as it sees fit, or try to, at any rate. Regardless, why am I to be your concern?~
@23590 = ~So you say, but your actions have branded you less than desirable. Do you even have the will to try and restrain your ways while here, or are you a lost cause and just content with it? I shall determine, and judge as I see fit, for none else here have the power to do so. You will perform a task for me. I will send you where you must go, and you will return with the item I need. A simple cloak is your target, but do NOT wear it! It is mine and you will know the punishment before you get a second chance.~
@23591 = ~Shandalar's Cloak~
@23592 = ~This cloak was originally stolen from Shandalar by the powerful mage Semia, presumably for the powerful magics woven into the fabric. Although, how it has come to be in your possession and the fate of Semia are complete mysteries, and ones not likely to be solved. Much like the exact workings of the cloak, which would remain a mystery even to a powerful mage.~
@23593 = ~And if I refuse this task?~
@23594 = ~This item, why do you not get it yourself?~
@23595 = ~Take your judgements and your morals and get out of here before I decide to take offense.~
@23596 = ~Because your business is unsavory and I don't like it. Your actions have branded you, and I must determine if such a brand is accurate and deserved. Cows are branded, but there's is not the will behind it. Likewise, perhaps you are of good intent but are just inept. Thus is my quandary.~
@23597 = ~You will do a task for me, and prove your worth. Success means I may not kill you outright. Failure means I will not have to deal with you again anyway. I seek a simple cloak of mine. You will retrieve it and then you may return. Do not wear it, as it is mine and you will not survive.~
@23598 = ~And if I refuse this task?~
@23599 = ~This item, why do you not get it yourself?~
@23600 = ~Take your judgements and your morals and get out of here before I decide to take offense.~
@23601 = ~I have already challenged, and you have answered as a spoiled child. It is as I expected, but before you get your candy today you must do something for me. I propose a task that you must complete. If you are of worth, perhaps you will survive and I shall not kill you outright. Perhaps you won't survive and I will not have to worry about it. Perhaps I will forget you there, so do be polite.~
@23602 = ~And if I refuse this task?~
@23603 = ~This item, why do you not get it yourself?~
@23604 = ~Take your judgements and your morals and get out of here before I decide to take offence.~
@23605 = ~You presume to have a choice where you do not. Silly you. Silly silly you. You will go now. Take this item as a passage back. This wardstone will be your savior once you have what I require. Goodbye, good luck, and good riddance.~
@23606 = ~Because I am busy. Because I have better things to do. Because it is menial, dangerous, tiresome, a chore... you choose whichever reason makes you happy and full of cheer. You will do this regardless, and you will do so now. Here is a wardtoken that will return you once the chore is done and you have the item. Do be quick about it.~
@23607 = ~Who are you to speak of offence? Your very aura offends. You will do this, and you will do it now. Here is wardtoken that will return you once the task is done. Be grateful I remembered to give it to you.~
@23608 = ~Andris~
@23609 = ~Andris~
@23610 = ~I know of you. You are of an odd countenance, and I can count pretty darn high, too. I have need of you... what say you to this?~
@23611 = ~I do not know who you are. Introduce yourself, and we shall see if I can help you.~
@23612 = ~I have no time for you, old man. Whoever you are, I'd ask you to kindly get out of my way!~
@23613 = ~I do not know what to say. I do not know you are what you intend. Speak your mind and then I will decide.~
@23614 = ~I am Shandalar, and I am the default benefactor of this place. My home is here, as are my major interests. I take interest in whoever comes this way, and you are very interesting indeed. I should like you to perform a task for me. A small thing, really, but something I do not have time for myself. I need for you to go to... another place... and retrieve an item of mine. Very simple, and if you succeed I will think all the better of you. What say you to this?~

I would ask a task of you, and now I think it all the more appropriate that you accept. I will judge the measure of you, and see what your respectable veneer has paneled over. You will retrieve a cloak for me, one that was left in a rather unfortunate place. When you have found it you will be returned. I think you will agree this is a menial chore.~

@23625 = ~Sensible. You may truly be as you appear, but I still must test to assure your nature. I would ask a task of you, that you retrieve an item I lost some time ago. You will be sent from this place to another place, and when you have succeeded, you will be allowed to return. Simple enough in my mind, though most things are, these days. The item is a cloak I have... misplaced. Your retrieving it will ease the burden of a busy evening. What say you?~

@23633 = ~Will there be suitable reward for this task?~
@23634 = ~Newcomers, stop where you are! I have questions to pose to you, and you will answer them swiftly and accurately, or you will be killed. I will warn you now that I possess powerful magics, and will be able to discern almost any lie that you try to tell.~

@23645 = ~I have other things that call my attentions, so it is more convenient that you go. Besides, I know you not and this serves as a good measure of you. Already I know you are more interested in the "why" and not so much the profit. Will you do this?~
@23646 = ~I am Dinklemus Littlelog, and have come here in search of the holy groundhog.~
@23647 = ~Splendid. You will be leaving immediately. As for where you will be going, the location is a bit indeterminate. You will understand when you arrive. Are you ready to go now?~
@23648 = ~We're trapped here, just like you. We angered a mage of great power and he transported us here as punishment.~
@23649 = ~Not right now, I need time to prepare.~
@23650 = ~Yes I will. I'm ready now.~
@23651 = ~I am Garan, and have been trapped on this infernal island ever since I tried to teleport from Maztica to Waterdeep. But it is not you who should be asking the questions. You have not answered my question yet; answer now or suffer the consequences.~

@23653 = ~I am Dinklemus Littlelog, and have come here in search of the holy groundhog.~

@23656 = ~No, I need time to prepare.~
@23657 = ~Yes, I can leave right now.~
@23658 = ~You have come to take Shandalar's cloak, eh? Well, he must have given you something to get off of the island, something that I intend to have. Prepare to die, fools!~
@23659 = ~Now you see, I knew this was a good idea. Already I have a clearer picture of your worth, and I have not even sent you on the task yet. The profit will be directly related to your performance. In essence, anything you scrounge above and beyond my needs is yours. Sufficient?~
@23660 = ~Your joke will be the last that you ever make; now you DIE!~

@23664 = ~No, I need time to think it over.~

@23671 = ~Yes, I will leave right now.~
@23672 = ~No, I need further time to prepare.~
@23673 = ~You return! Excellent! And you are little the worse for wear, in a relative sense. An excellent measure of your worth, I think. You have proven yourself quite capable. I will just relieve you of that item and be on my way.~
@23674 = ~Hehahee-he-heeee... Been here long?~
@23675 = ~What was that place? There are people still trapped on that island.~
@23676 = ~No and I don't intend to stay here long, either.~
@23677 = ~A pleasure doing business. It was a profitable venture.~
@23678 = ~Long enough, though I can't say I've seen you before. By what name shall I call you, friend?~
@23679 = ~I do not appreciate doing your dirty work. That was more a prison than anything else!~
@23680 = ~It is an odd place, to be sure. Teleportations are affected most drastically in effect trapping the occasional passing mage. Those that are there will find their way off in time. Those that are not there anymore have found their own way off. I think you will agree that the ones that you met were not inclined to work together and effect their own release. An excellent judge of character in a supposedly natural phenomenon, wouldn't you say? I must be off. Fare ye well.~
@23681 = ~Out of my way, old man. I have a job to do and little desire to do it.~
@23682 = ~I am sure it was. The place tends to snag the occasional passing mage teleporting across the Trackless Sea. Such people are never ill-equipped, though all their gadgets weigh them down quite a bit. If they were more inclined to leave such things behind they might find their release from that place a bit easier. Passive resistance is best when the very ground seems to drag magic to it. That is why you were needed to retrieve my cloak. I must be going now. Pleasure knowing.~
@23683 = ~And what if it was? It is not of my making. I myself was once a resident for a time. It tends to snag passing teleporting mages from time to time. I left my magics and gadgets and was able to use some minor incantations to escape. Passive resistance is more successful when the very ground seems to drag magic to it. The others might find their release if they lose the anger and attachment to their toys. Ah, I will not argue this with you, the place was not of my making. You have done well enough. Goodbye.~
@23684 = ~You return. You are proven capable, at least in this respect. Certainly you have the will to change your personal ways as well. We are square and fair, for the moment. I cannot guarantee that we will remain so, however, as your kind is to be scrutinized closely. Rather a nonexistent short-term memory as well, I'm afraid. You have done me a favor, now do yourself one. Behave yourself until you are of positive standing in the community. Begone.~
@23685 = ~You return. I cannot say I am totally pleased with that, but you have done me a service, nonetheless. You may live, but we are still not square and fair. Cross my path again and the deaths of my daughters will be the fuel that drives my anger! You wouldn't like me when I'm angry. For now, I am satisfied, but only for now. Leave me now.~
@23686 = ~No, no, none of us do, none of us do... Did you think I wanted this place?! Did you think I wanted to languish here for years, Tellan Altru'ar, once the shining light of Tethyr?! ...No, no, hehahee-he-heeee, not I, not I. Now give me that wardstone, buttercup, or I shall pluck your petals and watch ye rot!~
@23687 = ~Well, well, well. I sensed the ripples and there you are but... you are something new. Tell me, friend, how come you to this place?~
@23688 = ~Against my will and none too pleased about it! Who in blazes are you?~
@23689 = ~I was asked to come. I'm here to retrieve an item for a friend. Who are you?~
@23690 = ~I was sent by Shandalar. Seems there is something of his on this island that he wants returned.~
@23691 = ~Hrmmm... You may call me Tellan Altru'ar, the shining light of Tethyr, for once I was, once I was. And you I shall call Buttercup because I can and shall, hoo-hooo! ...You have a way out of here, don't you? I smell it on you!~
@23692 = ~Shandalar~

@23694 = ~Please don't kill me! Please, please, please, please, please!~

@23697 = ~Beg if you wish, dog. Your life is at an end.~
@23698 = ~Kill you? Please don't kill us! Please, please, please, please, please!~
@23699 = ~Why are you here? You weren't sent to kill poor Cuchol?~
@23700 = ~We're merely here to retrieve an item. We'll be on our way as soon as we can find it.~
@23701 = ~So you are Cuchol? In truth, we are here to kill you.~
@23702 = ~That troll! Even in this accursed place she sends assassins. If Cuchol must die, then he shall not die alone.~
@23703 = ~What manner of heartless beasts are you? Mocking poor Cuchol even as you bring his doom? Why, if I were back in Surkh, Yspank would protect me!~
@23704 = ~Oh really, Cuchol, beasts? We prefer hired goons.~
@23705 = ~Relax, fellow; we have no reason to harm you.~
@23706 = ~I do, but it comes with a price. There is a cloak I need to find and many here who would see me and my master dead before they let it fall from their grubby hands. Follow me and be of some assistance in the battles and mayhaps I'll let you come with me when I go.~
@23707 = ~Are you not trapped here? I Cuchol, the Scourge of Lachom! The Ravisher of Surkh! Even with my fell powers, I cannot escape.~
@23708 = ~We have our ways, Cuchol. Have you seen a cloak, perhaps?~
@23709 = ~A ward! Of course! My friends, I have been trapped here for too long. Think of my reputation! "Cuchol," they'll say, "What kind of mystical magic man are you?" Then I'll say "It's not my fault! It's that stupid ice!" Then they'll say "You're a loser Cuchol. A real fool, if you catch my drift." Can't you see? My reputation! I must have that ward! I must escape!~
@23710 = ~Here, take the cursed thing. Just shut up!~
@23711 = ~Probably the same way you did. Why don't you tell me your story and see if it's the same as mine?~
@23712 = ~Shandalar! Well, there is a name I have not heard in awhile. Aye, he was here. The bastard managed to escape, though I know not how. This isle is much like a prison, and is uncharted on any map I have seen. The stars indicate we are far to the south, but I cannot seem to get more precise than this.~
@23713 = ~We can't help you, Cuchol. We need to leave this place ourselves.~
@23714 = ~As you wish...~
@23715 = ~Hah, hah! Imagine her surprise when I show up in her bedchamber. "Oh, Cuchol, you've the body of a god!" she'll say. But enough of this! You are no longer useful.~
@23716 = ~But it's so cold! Don't you see? It's cold! Why does Cuchol bother with these wretches? Very well, I MUST have the ward!~
@23717 = ~You would? Really? No, you wouldn't, you wouldn't... but you could... Hehahee-he-heeee. No magic, though, I will save my magic in case you turn on me... But darts, yes, I'll cast my darts into their very eyes if it shall get me off this frigid rock!~
@23718 = ~I am Andris, and you will lower your voice or find yourself swimming. Hmm... perhaps you have come in the normal way after all. Most are not too happy about arriving here. No doubt you are confused, but I will explain. Here is the island. It has no other name than this, and is too small to appear on any map. By the stars I would place us deep in the Trackless Sea, perhaps even further afield than far-southern Chult, though I cannot really say.~
@23719 = ~Sensed the ripples? Speak some sense, man! And speak your name!~
@23720 = ~Well I have nothing to do and a vast intellect that starves for some enjoyment! On your hands and knees, child!~
@23721 = ~You are just the latest teleporting fool to be captured. This place seems a magnet of sorts. If you are powerful enough to transport without error across an ocean, you are apparently of sufficient power to be caught and dragged here. It is the very place that does it... seems to ensnare the energy. Needless to say, leaving the island by magical means seems entirely impossible. You will get used to seabird eggs if you wish to survive.~
@23722 = ~Polar Bear~
@23723 = ~Polar Bear~
@23724 = ~I am Andris, and that is some strange kind of friend you have. This isle is as uncharted as they get and may as well be a prison. The stars say we are deep in the Trackless Sea, perhaps even more south than Chult, if that is possible.~
@23725 = ~This place seems to ensnare magical energy, pulling it from the air. If you are a mage in transport, it pulls you as well. Plucks you from the ether and deposits you here. Leaving the island by magical means seems entirely impossible.~
@23726 = ~Who constructed such a place? What is its purpose?~
@23727 = ~Is there no means to escape? It must be possible.~
@23728 = ~And you've taken the role of island greeter? I think not. What do you want?~
@23729 = ~I don't know an answer to either question. It could be a joke of the gods, or a test... or both. It is hard to tell with gods. It could be a natural phenomenon, though these tunnels certainly are not. Trapped mages may have fashioned them for shelter however. There is little else to do here except plot, study, or go mad. I prefer to plot. On that note, if you would be so kind as to strip down and give me what you are carrying I would be ever so grateful.~
@23730 = ~Oh, certainly it must. Whether this place is a joke, test or simply phenomena, it is just a matter of finding the proper method of exit. I favor the pure power theory, wherein you merely need an excess of magical resources to overpower the pull. I am gathering all the power I can, to whit I must ask that you strip down. Nothing personal, but I really need whatever you are carrying.~
@23731 = ~What do I want? What do I want!? To be free of this place! It does not matter whether this place is a joke, test or phenomena, I need more power to escape! If you would kindly strip of your belongings I would be ever so grateful.~
@23732 = ~Shandalar gave me the means. I have to find a cloak of his and then I can leave.~
@23733 = ~Perhaps I have a way off. Perhaps it is of value to you?~
@23734 = ~What is the purpose of this place? Who constructed it?~
@23735 = ~You seem quite at home here... deceptively so. What is it you want from me?~
@23736 = ~PERHAPS it is of value? PERHAPS!? You are a fool to tempt me if you lie, and a fool to have mentioned it at all! I will not barter, and I will not bargain! I will take everything on your corpse and find the means myself! Be this place a test, joke or phenomena, I will be free of it!~
@23737 = ~You have the means to leave? You are a fool to tempt me if you are lying, and even more a fool if you tell the truth! I care not a whit for your task, nor for your lives! If you possess the means to leave I must have it and have it now! I shall take it from you! You should not wave food in front of those who starve!~

@23752 = ~The drawer of this desk is locked with an unbreakable, odd-looking lock. You will have to find the key.~
@23753 = ~But why? I think I can overpower the pull of this place if I have enough magical energy. You may have items, or your very being may yield fuel. I care not which, and I am through talking!~

@23760 = ~Now now now, hello there. And you might be who? Another wayward spellslinger looking for a way out? Or just another power-hungry fool trying to force the doors from the wrong side? Tell me, warrior, why is it that whatever you seek is always in the last place you look?~
@23761 = ~Um... because you find it?~
@23762 = ~I have no time for your riddles! I seek a cloak that belongs to Shandalar!~
@23763 = ~This place has addled your senses. No doubt you will be no friendlier than any of the others here.~
@23764 = ~Ha! The commonsense answer, in a place uncommon where sense does not rule the day. You are looking for something here: something of power and value. I am sure I know just what it is, and for whom you seek it. I do not wish to relinquish it. What do you have to say to that?~
@23765 = ~Do you now? And he did not come for it himself? Of course not. He left this place only by shedding his most powerful dweomers. More sensible to send you, who are of lesser power. No doubt he will extricate you using some sort of focus, drawing you away with magic centered elsewhere once you have completed your task. Have I guessed your means of travel? Do you even know?~
@23766 = ~The others here are like me, in that they do not understand this place. I doubt the place itself could tell its own purpose were it able to answer questions. Suffice it that I am not so quick to turn to desperation as the others, and I do not fear the unknown quite so much. If this place draws magical energies to it, and I am here at the center, then it draws magical energy to me by default. In time I will harness it, and in time I will leave. Already I know more of things here than any other. I can see things... things others cannot.~
@23767 = ~How do you know these things of me?~
@23768 = ~It is irrelevant. By this admission you have stated what I need to know. I will take what you have whether you permit it or not.~
@23769 = ~I have a task, plain and simple. You can aid it or oppose it, but you will not ignore it.~
@23770 = ~Our conversation is to be a short one, then. Launch your spells and wield your weapons, for one of us will cease breathing this day. It matters little. I see things here that others cannot, and I have an understanding of what comes. Take what you need and finish your task, and be released with the power of another in a different place. He will thank you in his fashion, I am sure. Attack as you will, and one of us will go to join the others.~
@23771 = ~I ignore nothing here, and I see far more than you. I have been here long and have used my time effectively. Some fall or go mad, but I have learned. Do I understand this place? No, but I begin too. It stores what it brings for something long since forgotten. Perhaps when I remember it I will master it... perhaps not. You are but an interloper, a messenger, and the power of someone else will remove you from afar. Do what you must, I can only gain in this. I win, I am released. I lose, I am released.~
@23772 = ~It is irrelevant. I have a task to do and you are in the way. Ignore me at your peril.~
@23773 = ~How do you know these things of me?~
@23774 = ~You have said more than I need to know. I must deal with you to complete my task.~
@23775 = ~Irrelevant. I only care about what I have been sent to retrieve. That is my escape from this place.~
@23776 = ~You have many answers. Can you tell me where to find Shandalar's cloak? I have to find it.~
@23777 = ~And what can you see? What is this place?~
@23778 = ~I see why you are here. I see that I have what you seek. I see that we must fight and the victor shall leave. What is this place? Many things. Today it is a dueling pit. Tomorrow it will be a graveyard. Yesterday it was... what? I cannot say. If it is natural it is an abomination. If it is divine, it is utterly cruel. We are all many things, including obtuse and unclear. Do what you will. If I win, I am released. If I lose, I am released.~
@23779 = ~Energy Drain~
@23780 = ~Polymorph Self~
@23781 = ~Some strange apparition appeared to me.
This is what it had to say:

I am the warrior's curse
I steal his future
I mar his past
The more he has, the less it seems
He becomes a slave
Of glittering things
Yet I hunger... Feed me that which glitters beyond all else.

I must pass these four warders to descend to the lower level. I assume that one of them will have the wardstone required to operate this lift that they are guarding. What glittering thing could this warder wish of me? Gold? A gem? I must solve this riddle to pass.~

@23783 = ~You have done what must, but now I stop. Here you hold, and here you must die.~
@23784 = ~Why must we fight? Cannot let you leave knowing all this. We could have existed peacefully, but now you have fought and will never accept. Others will come to kill or capture. Adventurers like you always come, do they not? No, I must fight, and you must die! We may still have hope if Selaad returns, but you cannot help anymore.~
@23785 = ~So it must be. We not leave, but neither will you. None must know of us, not know that we are threat. You will die, even if we must as well! Perhaps Selaad will bring another ship, but for now none will leave.~
@23786 = ~Such generosity, but if you leave you will exterminate anyway. Others will come, other fools just to fight the "evil" we are. No, we must remain alone here now, and so must you. Die and sleep, and you will not know the loneliness. Perhaps if Selaad returns we will try again. Until then, we stay.~
@23787 = ~Why should we fight? We can still leave on your ship. Why don't we all leave together?~

This blade has traveled far since its forging on the shores of the Shining Sea, though documentation of its passage is sketchy because of the mundane nature of the item. Such weapons are considered commonplace among the rich elite of the far south, and are of little consequence to historians of the area. This attitude is incomprehensible to a citizen of the Sword Coast, where people routinely die for items of equal or lesser enchantment. This particular blade may have belonged to a wealthy Vizir, or perhaps his attendant.

None know better than halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe. This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that leave the hearth to seek adventure. Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect. It would seem that halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to their history.

This is a legendary weapon of heroic proportions, especially among the far-northern tribes of barbarians. Champion after champion has wielded this blade against countless enemies, and the blood it has spilled could fill a small sea. History will not admit that such a blade could be forged and each consecutive owner seems to tie its origin to whatever creation myth they believe. The most grandiose of these tales is that of a great chieftain who sailed to the cliffs that supposedly bordered the world. There he reached into the void, and his will shaped the blade from nothing. Whatever the truth, in the right hands this sword is a fearsome thing.

Even the hordes have their heroes, and while they are vilified in civilized company, their deeds are sometimes impressive nonetheless. Krotan was an exceptionally intelligent orc, as far as orcs go, who commanded an ever-shifting legion of ogres, orcs, hobgoblins, and other assorted beasties during the Year of the Lost Lady, 1241 DR. It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed; though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orcs called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

@23970 = ~Long Sword +1, Flame Tongue: "The Burning Earth"
There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough -it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself, but whomever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It doesn't seem to hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging doubt that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

The traveling adventurer could ask for no better a suit of armor in all the land. Specially commissioned by Bolhur "Thunderaxe" at GREAT expense, this suit was his most prized, even if not his most ornate. Eminently practical, Bolhur demanded armor that would offer superior protection while hampering him in the least. By "hampering" he did not just mean in movement or weight: his ideal suit should be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur "Thunderaxe" neglected his armors (to say as such would get your ears boxed) but the regime of spit and polish required for a "gentleman's" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of Full Plate for kings and heads of state; a working dwarf cares more for utility than looks.

This finely crafted stave was among the spoils taken from the invaders of Durlag's Tower. It is very deadly in combat, and was apparently the property of a spellcaster that enjoyed standing on the frontlines. It appears to have a core of iron, yet it is comparable in weight to a normal weapon of its type. Part of the enchantment seems to come from the hide that strengthens the grip; leather no doubt made from a battle-ready creature of some sort. With the tastes and inclinations of the attackers of the Tower well documented, the hide could be almost anything... or anyone.

This finely made harp is well known among the nomadic peoples of the east, though more for the infamy of its owner, Greagan of the Low Hills. He was a bard, of sorts, though less for his love of people than his hatred of hard work. He bade a mage relation construct this harp so its magic might disguise his utter lack of talent in the arts. Its power was greater than he had hoped, and he later turned to petty burglary using "his" music to captivate his victims. Greagan ultimately disappeared some years ago amidst rumors of a bardic college uncharacteristically moved to violence. The harp still functions, though any self-respecting troubadour would reserve its use for the most dire of circumstances. The magic seems to be waning as well, and perhaps this is one item best lost to time.

Would that I had more paper to write upon, but much was burned in haste for warmth.

Know that Andris does curse you for your life, and that should I return in some fell form I will hunt you for the sheer spite of you seeing my decimated body. The business of that aside, I hope that you who read this have suffered the same fate as I. The indignity of this condition! With all the power at mine fingers I must huddle around a dung-fire eating seal fat! The forces behind this place have no respect for my stature, my power! I have slain beasts thrice my size with a glance, and traveled as a bird over oceans! Here my magic is sucked to the earth and I am held, as others are. Some have escaped, and I swear I shall hunt them and take the power they must have. To do what I cannot they must be great indeed. I curse them for leaving, I curse this place, and I curse that I have not the might to follow.

These walls will hold your power fast, unless I walk right through.
A boat I bade from birch and bark, but burned I did at morn.
Rather I gather in this held spot, than suffer my hands get worn.

Fools this place has, and many more to come. I will greet and take what will, and in the end will I have all? Oh, I think so. I mock your prison, AO, as though you would care to listen. Are you even behind the walls? I see your symbols in the sky, but others too. Mystra, goddess of magic, my magical maiden, why do you treat your children so? Do you give the sparkle of magic only so it cannot be used? A lesson in humility for those on the verge of true power? Drop your robes and wands and staves, or forever be trapped with your self-importance and pride? Perhaps, but I will not shed what I have earned just to walk the skies again. I shall profit from this; I will play outside your rules. This place will bring it all to me in time, though I can't take it elsewhere. No, you can't take it with you, but you can stay with it, and hold it tight. Perhaps with outside help? Bah! None but those who have learned can find this place again, and they will not interrupt the teaching. I will not bend; I will snap and strike back in time. Humility is so... humiliating, and I will not suffer more. Power impotent is still preferable to power lost.

Of course, perhaps the walls do not listen to such musings, and my writing is pointless. No matter, for tomorrow I shall wipe this clean and write anew. My verse gets better. One must have hobbies.~

@24047 = ~If you live long enough to fight the creatures that call this place home count yourself lucky. The very walls within will conspire to keep you at bay. Mere traps test only your dexterity, but this place is more than a simple doorknocker. Durlag was a sick, sick man, and I tell you that he meant to kill those that entered, not just hinder.~
@24048 = ~Ahh, so you have defeated many a monster to get here. Well, if you have seen another of what lives here now I would be greatly surprised. There is a creature here unlike any other, a beast that defies sound thought. I have heard of it before, but my party laughed and said I was just afraid. Afraid? Yes, but it is still true.~
@24049 = ~You should be afraid, fear is healthy. It keeps you from making mistakes, and in this place, mistakes will cost you your life. There are choices to be made in here, and they have deadly consequences. Durlag did not seem to believe in second chances.~
@24050 = ~Sure there be traps, triggered by wire or step or sound, but there are TESTS as well, tests he made to find friend or foe. You will need more than your agile fingers to escape what comes. Some traps give no second chance. Attention must be paid, or death will easily take you.~

It is truly beyond thought. What it is even doing here, I do not know. Durlag was certainly not in league with such a beast, but it has made a home here nonetheless.~

I say the risk, and if they wish to continue it is their own fate they decide. Me, I be thinking that it is better to live. This place is death. It is in the air, and it gets in your clothes. My friends, they say "by the gods, what is that stench?" And I tell them; it's the stink of death, citizens.~
@24063 = ~You know the lad, or did his mother send you to check on him? She is a worrisome little parent, isn't she? Perhaps rightly so, I worried about the boy too. He does not take much of this seriously, and when he realizes what he has been through it may be a rude awakening, to be sure. He is with my fellows, deeper than I wished to go. You may find them if you search, but I think the way they went has been blocked. There be so many passages it seems Durlag felt he could afford to collapse a few behind the unwary.~

Would that the sorrow was lifted as well... he is stubborn, my Durlag... this place will wax and wane in time... regret will not last forever... you can leave when you wish, I will send you...~

@24085 = ~Good spirit, you can send me away from this place? I will accept your offer.~
@24086 = ~Yes, I need spend no more time here. Send me to the surface.~
@24087 = ~Thanks just the same, but I will stay.~
@24088 = ~No, I don't wish to go quite yet.~

@24092 = ~When you read the final book, you hear a click as if something has been activated. A few seconds later you hear a humming sound and can see a glow coming from across the hallway.~
@24093 = ~You have raised my deeds in glory and my sword now glows with pride.~
@24094 = ~It seems that by causing the sword to glow I have completed some sort of task.~

@24104 = ~Husam wants us to kill two assassins named Slythe and Krystin. They are in the employ of Sarevok, and we might find valuable information in their possession. The two killers are staying at an underground brothel known as the Undercellar.~
@24105 = ~The village of Ulgoth's Beard lies on the banks of the River Chionthar, just upstream from Baldur's Gate and the open sea beyond. This farm-dotted countryside is usually a peaceful haven from the turmoil of the Sword Coast, although as of late the same cannot be said of Ulgoth's Beard itself. The simple fishing village has become the source of many a rumor in recent days. Rumors of an ancient cult risen again, unsubstantiated tales of a murderous creature stalking the night, and talk of strange goings on in the house of Shandalar, the powerful and eccentric mage who makes his home in the normally sleepy village. You have also heard with certainty that tours of the fabled Tower of Durlag operate from Ulgoth's Beard, and that it is truly a place where adventurers can test their mettle. Perhaps such a test will better prepare you to fight the darkness that threatens to destroy the Sword Coast and you with it.~

@24111 = ~Tales of the Sword Coast has installed new areas within the existing world of Baldur's Gate; all previous areas are still accessible to your party.
The experience point cap in Tales of the Sword Coast has been increased to 161,000, allowing you to gain new levels, items and spells.
To immediately start the mission pack load your final save. Doing so will transport your party to Ulgoth's Beard. If you do not have a final save you may use the save game "Mission Pack Save" to start the mission pack.
Note: You do not have to choose this method to enjoy the new areas; if you wish, you may load any save game and walk to the town of Ulgoth's Beard, where all of the new adventures begin.
To avoid this message box, you can use Load Game to get to the load screen.~
@24112 = ~Welcome to the Tales of the Sword Coast! This is a series of adventures created in the spirit of the Advanced Dungeons and Dragons module system, and it has considerably expanded the Baldur's Gate world. For your convenience, your party is being transported to the newly created community of Ulgoth's Beard. You will find this quaint village to be a gateway to new adventures and dangers, though you will also be able to continue exploring the Sword Coast you already know.
In the context of the overall Baldur's Gate campaign, the events you are about to embark upon take place before the final confrontation with Sarevok, and use the saved game that was created just before you entered his hidden lair. Once you have completed the mission pack you may wish to return to the depths beneath the great city of Baldur's Gate to finish off your murderous half-brother once more, stronger and better equipped than you could have been before. Be careful however, for Sarevok may not be quite as you remember.~
@24113 = ~Do you see these simple people before you? They are your kin now. Look at their smiling faces. Take their hands and know peace. We can sense within you, that the beasts have unwittingly given you the gift, and you can belong. Our fate is now your fate, and in time you will be as we, not as the beasts. We will shape and guide, for we are masters of ourselves. We are man, then animal, but more than both.~
@24114 = ~I had just begun exploring Durlag's Tower when I met a man by the name of Bayard. He seemed calm, though this place had frightened him and he was choosing to leave. Apparently his party are still within, having decided to go on without him. He wished them well, but would not follow. The traps and "tests" left by Durlag are beyond his ability, or so he seemed to think. Some are extremely lethal, offering no second chance to a trespasser. This place is not meant to hinder, but to kill. He is also afraid of the creature that has taken up residence here. It is apparently a "demon knight," some type of fell servant from the lower planes that is supposedly extremely powerful. Bayard feels that attacking such a creature directly is tantamount to suicide. Perhaps his fear will serve him well, but I must go onward. I shall keep an eye out for these "ward stones" that he mentioned as well. They must be keys of a sort.~
@24115 = ~One of Bayard's comrades was the lad named Dalton that I have come to rescue. Bayard thinks the boy is in over his head, but it is his head to do with what he pleases.~
@24116 = ~Okay.~
@24117 = ~Adventures you have seen and dangers you have faced, and through them all you have emerged alive. Creatures both fell and familiar have opposed you, and yet you have persevered. With your acts come a closure, and these Tales of the Sword Coast are behind you. However, the world continues, and it awaits your further adventures.~
@24118 = ~Tales of the Sword Coast has installed new areas within the existing world of Baldur's Gate; all previous areas are still accessible to your party.
The experience point cap in Tales of the Sword Coast has been increased to 161,000, allowing you to gain new levels, items and spells.
Warning: players joining multiplayer sessions of Baldur's Gate must have the same version of the executable in order to connect to each other. Having installed Tales of the Sword Coast you no longer are able to connect with players who have not installed the mission pack.~
@24119 = ~The Tanar'ri is dead. We need no reward for the task, as it was something that needed to be done.~
@24120 = ~I have misjudged the cult's power. I never believed them capable of freeing the tanar'ri. Ye have destroyed it for now. Eventually it will be able to return to this plane. Rest easy my friends. Ye did all that ye could do. Ye saved the Sword Coast from a demon. Farewell.~
@24121 = ~Speaking with this lout Karoug has proven ineffective, and combat is the only recourse. It seems to be all he understands. So be it. Likely the island will be better off without him. It shall be my favor to the other inhabitants.~
